Koeltl, a Clinton appointee, will preside over the case.\n\nTrump's campaign called the lawsuit\" frivolous\" and characterized it as \"a last-ditch effort to substantiate the baseless Russian collusion allegations\" by a party \"still trying to counter the will of the people in the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\n\"This is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,\" campaign manager Brad Parscale said. \"With the Democrats' conspiracy theories against the President's campaign evaporating as quickly as the failing DNC's fundraising, they've sunk to a new low to raise money, especially among small donors who have abandoned them. \"\n\nA DNC official acknowledged Friday that the lawsuit alleges no new evidence of cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russians. But the filing strings the publicly available information about the Trump orbit's contact with Russians into a single narrative. The official said that hadn't been done yet, and time was running out for the party's ability to bring the suit.\n\nThe Democratic Party alleges the conspiracy and the hacking hurt their relationship with voters, chilled donations, disrupted their political convention and subjected their staffers to harassment. The lawsuit outlines nearly every known communication between Trump advisers and Russians.\n\nIn all, it alleges a dozen crimes, from racketeering and conspiracy to wiretapping and trade secrets violations.\n\nDNC officials say they believe their lawsuit could recoup substantial monetary damages.\n\nIn addition to millions of dollars in damages related to the hack and other claims, the DNC is asking for an injunction that would stop any of the defendants from using material gained through the hack, and for a statement from the defendants admitting to the alleged conspiracy.\n\nThe party also could seek to interview some of the defendants under oath, as well as others with knowledge who aren't parties in the suit, and then make their findings public if the court allows it. Currently, two conspicuous names that aren't defendants in the suit are former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the President himself.\n\nThe lawsuit comes on the heels of a nearly year-long cybersecurity strengthening effort which was the initial internal DNC response to the hack -- for fortifying their systems and processes.\n\n\"We are not going to just stand by and let Russia hack the DNC,\" said one official. \"We are the victims.\"\n\n\"Roger Stone did not conspire, collude, or do any action to subvert the electoral process,\" Robert Buschel, Stone's lawyer, said Friday. \"Sadly, these meritless lawsuits against Roger Stone is not an effective form of therapy for loss the DNC suffered in 2016.\"\n\nPapadopoulos' lawyers declined to comment on the lawsuit the DNC filed against Papadopoulos and others Friday regarding an alleged conspiracy with Russia, while hinting that special counsel Robert Mueller continues to unravel details related to Papadopoulos' involvement with Russians and the campaign and to rely on the former Trump adviser.\n\n\"Mr. Papadopoulos continues to cooperate in the special counsel's investigation,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Democrats' narrative in the filing begins with Trump's announcement that he would run for president in 2015, the same year the New York tycoon indicated an interest in developing property in Moscow.\n\n\"As Trump moved closer to securing the nomination, the ties between his campaign and Russia's government grew substantially,\" the lawsuit alleges. It notes a trip to Russia by Flynn , meetings Papadopoulos held that discussed \"dirt\" Russians allegedly had on Clinton, the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting organized on the promise that Russia could help Trump's campaign, private communications that Trump Jr. and Stone had with WikiLeaks, and Manafort 's connections in Eastern Europe.\n\nParscale predicted the lawsuit would be dismissed. But if it goes forward, \"the DNC has created an opportunity for us to take aggressive discovery into their claims of 'damages' and uncover their acts of corruption for the American people,\" he said.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, the Democratic National Committee went public with claims that Russian hackers had gained access to their computer systems, obtaining emails and opposition research against Trump.\n\nDays before the Democratic National Convention, when Clinton was set to receive the party's presidential nomination, WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of hacked DNC emails.\n\nThe release of the emails, which included messages disparaging Bernie Sanders , threw the Democratic Party into turmoil at a moment when the party was supposed to be coming together in support of a nominee, and intensified infighting between supporters of Clinton and Sanders.\n\n\"The Democratic National Committee was the first major target of the Russian attack on our democracy, and I strongly believe that every individual who helped carry it out -- foreign or domestic -- should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC at the time of the hack, said in a statement Friday.\n\nProbing the contours\n\nMueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last year to investigate the same contours that the Democrats allege. As part of that mandate, Mueller is empowered to investigate any links between the Russian government and Trump campaign associates and bring criminal prosecutions.\n\nSo far, Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Flynn have pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about their interactions with Russians. Manafort has pleaded not guilty in charges related to his lobbying work for Ukrainian politicians before he joined the Trump campaign. Mueller's office has indicated they're interested in Manafort's links to Russians while he served on the campaign, though Manafort has not been charged for his actions in 2016.\n\nFlynn, Papadopoulos and Gates have agreed to help the federal authorities with their investigation. Mueller has also charged 13 Russians for using fraudulent accounts on social media to influence the election. Mueller has not yet brought charges related to the DNC hack.\n\nPapadopoulos' fianc\u00e9e has done several interviews, including with CNN, since his plea. He is not yet scheduled for sentencing.\n\n\"Revealing details at this point in time or responding to allegations made today would not serve the administration of justice. It is our hope that when all the facts are known, the plaintiff will voluntarily dismiss Mr. Papadopoulos from the complaint,\" Chicago-based lawyers Thomas Breen and Robert Stanley wrote in their press release on Friday.\n\nThe US intelligence community has concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered \"an influence campaign\" in 2016 with the goal of undermining public confidence in the US democratic process and eroding Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency.\n\nTrump, however, has repeatedly insisted that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russians, and has denounced the special counsel investigation as a \"witch hunt.\""}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/politics/trump-john-barron-forbes-wealth/index.html", "published": "2018-04-20T22:19:16", "title": "A new allegation says Trump lied about his wealth.

The automaker had been prepared to file bankruptcy Friday in South Korea when it failed to reach a cost-cutting deal in talks with its union by a company-imposed deadline. But it agreed late Friday local time to put those plans on hold until at least Monday evening while negotiations continue with the union and the South Korean government.\n\nA bankruptcy filing in South Korea will have little effect on GM's US operations. The overall company filed for bankruptcy in US federal bankruptcy court in 2009, in a reorganization process that was funded by a federal government bailout at that time.\n\nGM Korea has about 16,000 employees and about 300 dealerships in the country. But it is a distant third in terms of car sales in South Korea, well behind Hyundai and Kia which are both owned by Hyundai Motors. Figures from GM show it sold 132,000 locally-built cars in South Korea last year, or about 7.4% of the market. By comparison, Hyundai and Kia account for about two-thirds of the Korea market.\n\nGM also sold about 2,000 Cadillacs in South Korea that were built in US auto plants. Its overall South Korean sales in 2017 were down about 25% from a year earlier.\n\nRelated: American automakers won't get much help from new South Korean trade deal\n\nIn the South Korean market, GM Korea is essentially the third horse in a two-horse race said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst with Cox Automotive.\n\n\"Hyundai and Kia are so dominant here, that it's very difficult for anyone else to be profitable,\" she said from South Korea, where she was meeting with auto industry officials. She said the expectation among South Korea auto executives is that even if GM Korea reaches a deal to avoid bankruptcy, it's not necessarily long for the market.\n\nShe pointed out GM recently pulled out of a much larger and more important market in Europe to stem continuing losses.\n\n\"GM will probably pull out of the Korean market in three or four years,\" she said. \"It's just not worth it any more.\"\n\nBut the South Korean plants are essentially there to supply other markets, including the United States, with cheap small cars and SUVs. Last year it exported about 400,000 cars, as well as another 500,000 vehicle kits that went through final assembly elsewhere. Most of those exports go to the US and Europe. Less than 2% go to the major auto markets in Asia such as China or Japan.\n\nRelated: GM cutting 1,500 jobs at Ohio plant amid falling demand for small cars\n\nGM reports that GM Korea lost 148 billion South Korean won last year, or about $139 million. That's less than than the 2016 loss. GM Korea had already announced plans in February to close one of the four assembly plants it operates there. But it said it is willing to invest an additional $2.8 billion in GM Korea as part of a turnaround plan, but only if it can win a deal to cut costs and make the business profitable.\n\nGM Korea was formed out of the remains of Korean automaker Daewoo, which itself went bankrupt in 2000. GM bought about 45% of the company out of bankruptcy for $251 million in 2002, then invested an additional $571 million over the next decade to bring its stake up to 77%."}, {"link": "http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/20/media/avengers-infinity-war-box-office-week/index.html", "published": "2018-04-20T21:49:31", "title": "'Avengers: Infinity War' assembling for possible historic box office", "text": "Marvel has had some big numbers in its decade of blockbuster movies. 18 straight number one openings.

That's what happened when crews broke ground to begin the new Bay Area Calaveras Dam in 2013. They just didn't expect to find so many.\n\nThe existing 93-year-old Calaveras Dam stands only about a thousand feet from the Calaveras Fault, a proximity that prompted earthquake safety concerns.\n\nThe dam impounds the Calaveras Reservoir, which holds 40% of the area's water supply capacity. It's the largest Bay Area reservoir, said Betsy Lauppe Rhodes, regional communications manager for the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System.\n\nWith 2.7 million Bay Area customers relying on its water, the stability of the dam is critical. After careful study, a decision was made to rebuild the dam completely next to its existing location, Rhodes said in an email.\n\nThe dam's excavation required moving 10 million cubic yards of rock and soil. During initial project planning, shell fossils were noticed at the site, she said.\n\nShell fossils were the first evidence that the construction workers needed to call in a paleontologist.\n\n\"Because of this, the project team included a paleontologist who would monitor excavations and document and preserve anything we found,\" Rhodes said.\n\n\"What we were not expecting was this many fossils, of this variety. That was a complete surprise.\"\n\nThe construction workers were trained about what to look out for and instructed to cease work and alert the site paleontologist if they saw anything out of the ordinary. The paleontologist would then mark the fossil's location using GPS and remove it in a block of rock and dirt, sometimes with a plaster jacket around it to protect it during transportation.\n\nThe paleontologist for this site was probably busier than expected: It proved to be home to a treasure trove of fossils revealing what life was like in the area 15 million to 20 million years ago, and the most complete collection of fossils found in the Bay Area for more than 50 years. A combination of plant and animal fossils gives scientists a very clear picture of what conditions in an area were once like.\n\nTo ensure that the collection remained as intact as possible, the team reached out to regional institutions to see who could take on such a vast collection. Rhodes said that fossils found during construction on public or government land must by law be preserved and cared for by an official repository.\n\nA plaster jacket is opened, revealing the stone beneath it.\n\nThe University of California Museum of Paleontology , at the University of California, Berkeley campus, stepped up to the challenge. The school spent $500,000 to reopen a fossil prep lab. \"UCMP has been a great partner in that endeavor,\" Rhodes said.\n\n\"They have assembled a tremendous team and lab to prepare and categorize the fossils and make them available for future generations.\"\n\nAmong the finds were numerous fossilized palm trees and pine cones, hundreds of invertebrates including snails and crabs, shark teeth and whale skulls. There was also evidence of a previously unknown species of fossilized baleen whale. As the researchers continue their work, they expect to find more new species.\n\nThey have upwards of 20 whale skulls, each about 3 feet long. This is highly unusual for a \"salvage\" project, in which scientists try to excavate fossils from an active construction site that may be damaged.\n\n\"Thus far we have made significant progress on five complete skulls, and quite a few individual bones,\" Cristina Robins, senior museum scientist at the museum and head of the the project, wrote in an email.\n\n\"There are individual teeth from Desmostylus [a hippo-like creature] and seal. We have evidence for 4 different baleen whale species, and at least 2 toothed whale [dolphin or orca-like] species. Our largest whale is actually the most complete -- we have a 5-foot skull and 17 vertebra, plus some ribs,\" she wrote.\n\nRobins said she was surprised by the quality, as well as the quantity, of the fossils.\n\nGraduate student Mackenzie Kitchener-Smith spreads glue on a fossil to keep bone fragments together.\n\nAlthough the small invertebrates may seem less exciting, they help complete a time capsule of what life was like millions of years ago in what is now the Bay Area, especially the paleo-environment and climate, according to Robins.\n\n\"These are the first fossils ever collected from this particular part of the East Bay, and it has turned out to be one of the richest sites for marine mammals in northern California,\" she said.\n\n\"It is the first time that we have so many individuals of the same species of fossil whales from the same site. It is rare to find vertebrate, invertebrate and plant fossils that have been scientifically collected from the same rock units, so it will allow us to reconstruct the past environments with a level of detail that is very unusual for any site, and especially for ones on a construction site.

The notion that he will be able to quickly get a read on Mueller's team, said one source, is \"not serious thinking.\"\n\nAnother source familiar with the case added that dealing with Mueller is \"like going to talk to Abe Lincoln at the end of the mall -- a marble statue.\"\n\nChanging team\n\nThe new hires round out a more legal robust team for Trump.\n\nLawyer John Dowd has previously taken the lead on talks with Mueller, but Dowd's abrupt departure threw things into disarray and left Jay Sekulow, Trump's outside counsel, to deal with Mueller's team while scrambling to beef up the President's legal defense.\n\nNow Giuliani, the Raskins and Sekulow will serve as the President's outside counsel, while Ty Cobb will continue to serve as the White House special counsel. Attorney Joanna Hendon is representing Trump in the case involving Michael Cohen in the Southern District of New York.\n\nWhite House Counsel Don McGahn has been mostly focused on issues that don't involve the Russia investigation. A witness himself in the Mueller probe, McGahn has met with Mueller's team on at least three occasions to answer questions, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAt the outset of Giuliani's work for the President, he is expected to play a lead role in the interactions with the Mueller team.\n\n\"We're back on track and this should help bring this down the home stretch,\" said one source close to Trump.\n\nBut the President's team has expressed similar optimism in the past, only to be angered and disappointed when their expectations didn't pan out.\n\nUntil the FBI raid on the office, hotel and home of Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Mueller's team and Trump's lawyers had been in discussions over whether the President would sit for an interview with the special counsel.\n\nDiscussions with Mueller's team have been in \"limbo,\" since then, according to a source with knowledge. News of the raid blindsided Trump's lawyers, who considered the move a \"major breach of trust\" that shattered the assumptions of good faith going into the negotiations, one source previously told CNN. Another said it left the President's team feeling \"fundamentally misled.\"\n\nMueller's team isn't likely to change its approach simply because of Giuliani's presence, a source said.\n\nStill, Giuliani knows Mueller from prior work at the Justice Department as well as Mueller's tenure as FBI director while Giuliani was New York's mayor. Some Trump allies are hopeful that Giuliani will be able to elicit a different reaction -- if only because he'll approach the talks differently himself.\n\nWhile Trump's legal team has already gone back and forth with Mueller's team about topics for an interview with the President, Giuliani may discourage Trump from testifying, a source said.\n\n\"He'll look at those 49 questions and say, 'What are you wasting my time for?'\" the source said.\n\nGiuliani told CNN in an interview that he intends to obtain a list of what is necessary to \"comply\" with the rest of the investigation from Mueller. He predicted that compliance could be completed in \"a couple of weeks.\"\n\nGiuliani's personal relationship with Trump, who has a habit of pinging longtime friends and advisers for counsel, was another bonus in adding him to the team, a source said. He and Giuliani are known to speak on the phone and hit the links together. When the two men spoke at Mar-a-Lago recently, Giuliani told the President he wanted the job, one of the sources said.\n\nGiuliani also served as a loyal foot soldier in some of the darkest moments during Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nIn the aftermath of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape showing Trump bragging about groping women, then-Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and then-Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway both canceled their appearances on Sunday morning news shows. Giuliani, meanwhile, faithfully made the rounds on television defending Trump.\n\nYet Giuliani could also find himself embroiled in an offshoot investigation. In late October, during the presidential election, Giuliani went on Fox News to tease some \"big surprises,\" saying, \"We've got a couple things up our sleeve that should turn this around.\"\n\nTwo days later, then-FBI Director James Comey announced he was reopening the investigation into Clinton's emails.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Comey said he commissioned an investigation into leaks from the bureau's New York office after Giuliani's remarks and other leaks in the media.\n\n\"I don't know what the result of that was,\" Comey said. \"I got fired before it was finished.\"\n\nGiuliani has said in the past he had no insider information.\n\nHow the Raskins' expertise helps\n\nWhile the Raskins did not have a prior relationship with Trump, they met with the President recently at Mar-a-Lago, two sources said. Trump was impressed with their expertise and approved their hiring.\n\n\"What you've got here are two very serious white-collar lawyers who know how to defend their clients,\" CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin said of the Raskins. \"That's what the President needs.\"\n\nIt's not clear where the Mueller investigation will ultimately lead, but the Raskins' experience in financial crimes could prove useful, Zeldin said. Mueller has already built out a team of lawyers with financial crimes expertise as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in 2016 and potential collusion with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Raskins are expected to spend more time in Washington to interact with the Mueller team. Jane Raskin worked with Mueller at the Justice Department and at a law firm with James Quarles, one of the senior prosecutors on the Mueller team who is assigned to matters related to Trump, according to sources familiar with the workings of the Mueller team.\n\nThey could also serve as a moderating force to Giuliani's blunt style, Zeldin said.\n\n\"They're not limelight people,\" said Zeldin, who overlapped with Jane Serene Raskin when they both worked at the Justice Department. \"They're team players.\""}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/opinions/isis-bride-children-opinion-lemmon/index.html", "published": "2018-04-20T23:04:07", "title": "The ISIS bride problem: Don't take it out on the children", "text": "Gayle Tzemach Lemmon is a CNN contributor and adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Like thousands of evacuees, she landed here in central Florida. And, like hundreds, she's still stuck in a motel.\n\nSeven months after the storm, the quick-witted 50-year-old with chestnut hair and a warm smile has become the de facto mayor of \"El Super Ocho,\" or Super 8, the beige motel in the shadow of Disney World where she lives with her husband and two children. She keeps business cards of apartment managers, case workers and potential employers spread out on a table by the motel room door -- anything that might help her neighbors figure out how to survive the complex and increasingly eternal limbo they find themselves in.\n\nThis week, hundreds of evacuees were told they would be booted from the motels where they've lived rent-free on assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. On Friday at 1 p.m., after mounting pressure from members of Congress, Puerto Rico's governor and evacuees like Millie, as well as multiple inquiries from CNN, FEMA announced it would extend the motel assistance for Maria survivors until May 14.\n\nMillie and others didn't know where they would have gone without the extension. And after what one advocate described as a week of panic, they still don't know what will happen next month.\n\nShe does know what happens to evacuees who lose the motel vouchers, though: There's the mother of two who says she slept several nights in a car after FEMA's motel-room assistance ran out in March. There's the family of eight -- four children, their parents and grandparents -- who slept together in a motel room with only two beds. In that room on a recent day, a 7-year-old girl ate spaghetti for lunch using the end of a plastic coat hanger as a utensil.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hurricane Maria evacuees living in FL motels Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hurricane Maria evacuees living in FL motels 03:45\n\nSome families say they've relocated four, five and six times to avoid sleeping on the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, shelters near Kissimmee, the southern suburb of Orlando that's come to be known as \"Puerto Rico north,\" are full. Low-income housing is unavailable. Rents are out of reach. Non-profits have been sapped of resources. And federal aid for the evacuees either is running out or was never offered.\n\nAt issue are two FEMA housing programs. One, called the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, pays motel bills for people whose homes were damaged in Puerto Rico, even if the disaster victims left the island. That program, according to FEMA documents, was designed to be used for about two weeks. It has been extended repeatedly. More than 1,200 cases in the 50 states had been determined by FEMA to be ineligible for continued assistance after this week, according to documents provided to CNN, with about half of those cases in Florida.\n\nSonia Burgos and her grandchildren, ages 14 and 12, live at the Super 8 motel in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nIn a letter to FEMA on Wednesday, Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, requested an \"unconditional extension\" of the motel program.\n\n\"It is vital that FEMA approve this request immediately so that countless Puerto Rican families, who have lost everything as a result of this catastrophic disaster, are not once again uprooted in a chaotic fashion,\" he wrote. \"If FEMA does not approve the (Puerto Rico) government's request, students currently finishing the school year in the mainland will be deprived of their education, as well as their housing.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether FEMA will decide to extend the program beyond May 14.\n\nThe federal agency contests the assertion that it would put people out on the street by ending their assistance. The Transition Shelter Assistance program is meant to provide emergency housing in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. It is \"tragic\" so many families have had to continue to live in motels for months without other viable housing options, said Mike Byrne, FEMA's federal coordinating officer for Puerto Rico, in an interview with CNN last week.\n\n\"There comes a point when these problems are no longer really disaster problems but are social problems,\" Byrne said. \"The idea that we're throwing people on the street -- there's no accuracy, there's no truth to that type of thing.\n\n\"We are doing everything we can to help these people,\" Byrne said, \"but if their home is fixed, or they have the ability to stay with family or friends ... and they choose that they don't want to go back (to Puerto Rico), then, quite frankly, they fall out of this program\" offering motel rental assistance.\n\n\"They've made a decision not to use the assistance that we've provided,\" he said. \"That's their decision. And this is a free country.\"\n\nApplicants can lose the FEMA motel vouchers if their homes in Puerto Rico are found to be livable, after inspection; or if FEMA finds they have other viable housing options, such as friends they could live with, among other requirements, said Byrne.\n\nThose restrictions were at least temporarily lifted to allow disaster victims to keep getting assistance until next month. Evacuees should contact FEMA if they believe their case was handled unfairly, Byrne said, and individual aid may be extended beyond May 14 if warranted.\n\nLisbeth Cruz, right, has been looking for a place to rent but hasn't been able to find anything affordable. She watches out for her neighbor's child at the Super 8.\n\nTransitional Shelter Assistance isn't the only FEMA program stirring controversy, however.\n\nAnother FEMA program, called Direct Lease, could pay for longer-term rentals, which advocates say would be more humane and prevent homelessness among evacuees. That FEMA housing program, however, has not been made available to Hurricane Maria evacuees living in Florida or other US states.\n\nFEMA is offering that assistance only to evacuees who return to Puerto Rico, or to people who never left the island. FEMA will go so far as to pay for a person's flight back to the Caribbean island, Byrne said. No one has taken the agency up on that offer yet, he said.\n\nAsked why the Direct Lease program is not offered in Florida, Byrne at first said that he believed Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 had not requested it.\n\nCNN, however, obtained a January 31 letter to FEMA from a member of the Rossell\u00f3 administration requesting Direct Lease assistance for \"eligible evacuees from Puerto Rico not only here on the island, but also for those located across the United States.\"\n\nIn response, Byrne said it would not be prudent to provide long-term lease payments for people living in Florida rather than in the territory directly hit by the disaster. In his lengthy career, which has included working on the response to Superstorm Sandy and other emergencies, FEMA had never provided long-term housing in that way, he said.\n\n\"The reason they are eligible (for FEMA assistance) is because they had a home in Puerto Rico. And so we're going to provide the option of a home in Puerto Rico,\" he said.\n\nMeaning: Not in Florida.\n\nHurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September. Hundreds of evacuees have been stuck in motel rooms for months.\n\nIn the void, at least in part, there's Millie. She receives many of the evacuees' tearful phone calls. They knock on her motel door late at night. She tries to counsel her neighbors and new friends as they are evicted and struggle to find affordable housing -- a process some evacuees described as so stressful it had induced panic attacks. And she coordinates with community advocates and aid organizations.\n\nIn short: She's trying to help others before herself.\n\n\"The captain is always the last to leave the ship,\" she said.\n\nResearchers fear an 'exodus' from Puerto Rico\n\nCentral Florida long has been a destination for Puerto Ricans. The island is a US commonwealth home to 3.3 million American citizens, and residents can move freely to the 50 states without visas or other documentation.\n\nNew York once was seen as the mecca for Puerto Rico outmigration. It's been eclipsed more recently by Florida, in part because of the warm climate that's more similar to Puerto Rico and also because of what community advocates call the \"Disney Dream\" -- a fairy-tale vision of Orlando and its theme parks.\n\nPuerto Rico was suffering a massive and unprecedented population loss before Hurricane Maria hit, largely because of a debt crisis that bankrupted the island's government and crippled the economy. After Maria, some demographers told CNN they feared an \"exodus\" lasting many years, with repercussions for Puerto Rico and for host communities on the mainland.\n\nAs CNN reported in February, Florida -- particularly the Orlando-Kissimmee area -- appears to be the top destination for Maria evacuees. That assessment is based on a review of FEMA disaster assistance data and US Postal Service change-of-address requests from Puerto Rico.\n\nWhile it's impossible to say exactly how many people fled the island after the storm, estimates range from thousands to more than 100,000. In Florida alone, the state's department of education told CNN this week that nearly 12,000 new students from Puerto Rico have enrolled in public schools in the months since Hurricane Maria. The two top school districts for enrollees in Florida were Orange County, which includes Orlando, and Osceola County, which is home to Kissimmee.\n\nEvacuees are arriving to find that Orlando and Kissimmee offer anything but the \"Disney Dream\" they imagined -- or that they saw on vacations and heard about from relatives.\n\nLike many cities in the United States, Orlando and Kissimmee suffer from a crippling affordable-housing shortage, making it difficult if not impossible for evacuees to find stable housing outside of motels. A March report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition named Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford the third-worst large metro area in the nation in terms of affordable housing availability. For every 100 renters needing low-income housing, the report said, only 17 units are available.\n\nGovernment housing programs are not meeting needs, either. The Orlando Housing Authority told CNN it had 18 units -- total -- available when the storm hit. Neither that housing authority nor Osceola County, which includes Kissimmee, had any new and available Section 8 vouchers that could be used by evacuees. Those vouchers let recipients search for subsidized housing. Only evacuees who brought Section 8 vouchers from Puerto Rico could qualify to transfer those vouchers, according to Vivian Bryant, president and CEO of the Orlando Housing Authority.\n\n\"We haven't received a new allocation of Section 8 vouchers,\" Bryant said. \"We are 101% leased up. We don't even have anything we can offer anybody.\"\n\nNon-profits and churches are strained, too.\n\nThere are currently no open shelter beds for homeless people in the Orlando metro area, said Martha Are, executive director of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. Additionally, the one shelter that serves homeless people in Osceola County, where many evacuees live along US Highway 192, takes only domestic-violence victims, she said.\n\nSo if evacuees came to a shelter after getting kicked off the FEMA motel program, would they be turned away? CNN asked.\n\n\"That's right,\" she said.\n\nWith federal help lacking, the financial burden of helping Maria evacuees in Florida is falling -- and falling hard -- on churches and non-profits, said Rev. Jose Rodriguez, from Iglesia Episcopal Jes\u00fas de Nazaret in Orlando . His congregation had been helping pay the rent of some Puerto Rico evacuees who lost or were not granted FEMA motel assistance, he said. But in mid-April the church had run out of grant money and donations, he said, and would have to stop assisting evacuees at least temporarily. In his view, FEMA is leaning too much on goodwill.\n\n\"They're homeless. They're couch surfing,\" he said of evacuees.\n\nPrograms that should be helping them transition to a stable life in Florida are \"failing them,\" he said.\n\nSociologists have documented what they call \"disaster fatigue\" that sets in months after an event like Hurricane Maria. People who may have been inclined to donate to Puerto Rico immediately after the September storm may not realize, or care, that needs continue so many months later, both on and off the island. Advocates in Florida worry that this fatigue may be without remedy.\n\nMeanwhile, the influx of Puerto Rican evacuees is expected to continue. Thousands of homes on the island have not had power in seven months. Just this week, the entire island was temporarily without electricity in a major blackout\n\nEight people, two beds, one motel room\n\nAt dawn, the kids walk out of motels to bus stops on a highway.\n\nSome are the children of Maria. Their homes were damaged or destroyed when the September hurricane smashed into Puerto Rico; they were left without power or running water, often both, for months; their parents were left jobless, or without clear job prospects on the island; and many of their schools were closed.\n\nSchool buses drop off children who evacuated Puerto Rico at motels along US Highway 192 in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nIn short: They fled for a safer, better life.\n\nFlorida said they were welcome.\n\n\"As Puerto Rico rebuilds, Florida remains committed to doing everything we can to help the families impacted by Hurricane Maria and aid in the recovery process,\" Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement issued October 2, the same day Florida declared a state of emergency in reference to the arrival of Puerto Rican migrants.\n\nMillie, the \"mayor\" of the Super 8 in Kissimmee, said she heard via social media that Florida planned to welcome evacuees and help them enroll in schools. She ran a day care -- named \"El Palacio de los Ni\u00f1os,\" or The Children's Palace -- in Carolina, a town not far from San Juan. She needed to find a personal generator to keep it operational. She came to Florida, she said, to enroll her kids in school and to sort out how to reopen her business. Later, however, inspectors closed the daycare because of her absence and because the facility lacked power and running water, she said. That's when she decided to stay here.\n\nPerhaps it's her experience with that daycare -- the parents of her students still send her photos from Puerto Rico; she misses the kids dearly -- that prepared her for the role of caring for evacuees.\n\nWith so many people in need, she felt like she had to help.\n\nShe does so joyfully, laughing as often as she cries.\n\nStill, it wears on her.\n\nAsked if there were some evacuees she hadn't been able to help adequately, she responded:\n\n\"All of them.\"\n\nCNN interviewed more than a dozen evacuees in the Orlando and Tampa metro areas. Few expressed any desire to return to Puerto Rico. And despite the difficulties they've had adjusting to motel life, many were grateful to FEMA, charitable organizations and family members who had given them places to stay.\n\nUS Highway 192 is home to motels and gift shops in the shadow of Disney World.\n\nDacny L. Quintero Segarra talked about the situation on the walkway outside her motel room in the Baymont Inn and Suites on US Highway 192 in Kissimmee -- a stretch of road, also known as Vine Street, that's home to at least 10 motels listed by FEMA as accepting motel vouchers. She had a Walmart bag tied over her hair. Beneath it, she had applied an ointment, she said, to stop the rest of her hair from falling out.\n\nShe attributes the problem to stress.\n\n\"I feel like this is Narnia,\" she said -- like everything is turned around.\n\n\"The housing situation is very, very, very bad,\" she said. \"Everything is a 'no.' They say they're going to help you but we've only helped each other -- Puerto Ricans banding together. I'm not interested in material things. All I want is shelter for my kids.\"\n\nQuintero told CNN that FEMA offered her a free flight back to Puerto Rico.\n\n\"If I tell them I want to go back to Puerto Rico, they would say, 'Here's the money, buy your tickets.' But it's not just that. I want to live here,\" she said, primarily because there are jobs and schools.\n\nDownstairs, her parents, Alfredo Quintero and Dacny Segarra, who goes by the same name as her daughter, live in a room with wide doors to accommodate Alfredo's wheelchair. The elder Dacny said she had stopped taking medicine she needs to prevent blood clots because she has no health insurance in Florida and can't afford the pills without it.\n\nShe said she was hospitalized in Florida because of blood clots in her legs.\n\nThe older couple was told this week that they would lose FEMA assistance after April 20. That was before FEMA announced the extension into May -- an announcement that came the day before their scheduled eviction.\n\nCarlos Lara Santos, who is raising a baby girl, Valentina, born on April 2, already knew he'd get to stay until May 14, he told CNN. The family is living in the Super 8 with seven children, including the newborn. \"If you have a home, it's comfortable, the conditions are better,\" he said. \"If you have to raise a child in a hotel room, it's not the same.\"\n\nWithout FEMA assistance, some families end up in a cycle of motel eviction and debt. Liza Hernandez had been living in a two-bedroom unit at the Super 8 in Kissimmee with seven of her relatives. Initially, the family got help with hotel fees from FEMA, she said, but that ran out. They were able to start paying for the Super 8 on their own because three of the eight family members work. Then the hotel rate went up to $113.40 per night. The family fled to the Unno Boutique Hotel -- $50.22 per night. There, all eight were crammed into one room with two beds. They haven't been able to find an apartment, she said.\n\nCarmen \"Millie\" Santiago, center, protests for an extension of FEMA motel aid on April 16.\n\nAt the other end of the highway, near a gift shop shaped like a massive orange -- \"Welcome to Florida: Take Some Home\" -- and another shop shaped like a wizard, Yamil Rodriguez was staying in a Holiday Inn. He said he had been putting the room on a credit card, and the hotel staff had been nice enough not to run the charge. He knew it wouldn't last, though.\n\n\"I'm waiting for a miracle,\" he said.\n\nOn April 9, he sent a panicked message to a reporter.\n\n\"I'm on the street right now.\"\n\nRodriguez landed in another motel later that night.\n\nHe and several other evacuees expressed gratitude toward the hotels that have housed them these past months. Many know the names of their housekeepers and greet them with hugs. Rodriguez said the Holiday Inn was kind to let the family stay as long as it did.\n\nSome Maria migrants know friends or family members in Florida and stay with them -- at least for a time. \"There's a saying in Spanish: 'After three days, the dead start to smell,\" said Julio, 53, who had been living, along with his wife and five of his six children, with a niece near Tampa. \"The house is getting small.\"\n\nThe landlord threatened to evict all of them on April 15, including the niece, if Julio and his family didn't move elsewhere, he said. By April 19, he'd moved to Jacksonville to live with his adult son and to look for work. The place is too small for all of them, he said, so his wife and five kids are still living with the niece in secret. \"It's like they're hiding out,\" he said. (CNN is not using Julio's last name in order to protect the family.)\n\nJulio expected to start work through a job placement service later this week.\n\nHe hopes to save up enough money so they might get their own place -- eventually.\n\n\"Thank God we're alive, you know, so we can continue on this journey,\" Julio said.\n\nStill, this sort of uncertainty can be exhausting -- and potentially dangerous.\n\nMelissa, a young mother of three, said her home in Puerto Rico was so damaged that she initially slept on the floor of her mother-in-law's house on the island. That situation became untenable so she decided to come to Florida. She didn't know anyone here well enough to ask for a place to stay, she said, so she slept in the airport in Orlando. ( The Florida governor ordered welcome centers be established in major airports in the state; Melissa, whose full name CNN is withholding to protect the privacy of her children, said she did not see the welcome center in Orlando).\n\nIn total, her family has lived in six locations since Hurricane Maria, she said.\n\n\"I feel like this is Narnia,\" one evacuee told CNN.\n\nIn March, when she lost FEMA motel assistance, she and her husband slept in their cars with their children, ages 4 and 9, for three nights.\n\n\"FEMA just told me, 'Call the Red Cross or look for a shelter,'\" she said.\n\nFEMA declined to comment on individual circumstances, citing privacy laws.\n\nMelissa posted a praying-hands emoji and a cryptic plea for help on her Facebook page. A friend responded with a temporary place to stay. She wore out her welcome before ending up back in motels. Now the family is paying $500 per month, she said, to rent a single bedroom in a house. She's not sure how long that will last, but it's better than paying weekly motel fees.\n\n\"I'm really thankful for the help we've gotten,\" said Melissa. \"They gave me jackets and blankets and supplies. The school treated us well.\n\n\"But FEMA? When there are children, you can't let people sleep on the street. It's not the same for an adult to be on the street as for kids to be.\"\n\n'This could have been done far more humanely'\n\nDisaster experts, community advocates and Democratic politicians are similarly critical.\n\nThe longer children live in motels the more likely they are to be exposed to \"toxic stress\" that can contribute to long-term problems in school and mental health issues, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York.\n\n\"It is an extremely urgent matter to get these families with their children into a stable situation that is predictable and reestablish a sense of routine,\" he said.\n\nRedlener said motels don't do that.\n\n\"It's an extremely makeshift, temporary answer to a very complex problem,\" he said. \"It doesn't work for long, living in a motel, especially a crowded motel. It is a terrible situation for a young child.\"\n\nFourteen familiy members live in several rooms at the Baymont Inn and Suites.\n\nPeople who flee disasters often think they will be able to escape trauma by relocating, he said, but that rarely proves to be the case. The hurricane follows them. The best way to help disaster survivors recover, he said, is to provide longer-term apartment housing.\n\nFEMA does offer a \"Rental Assistance\" program for hurricane victims, both in Puerto Rico and in the 50 states. The agency has allocated $121 million to that effort, but officials told CNN they were unable to say how many recipients of that assistance were living in the states versus Puerto Rico.\n\nThe program provides disaster survivors with a monthly rental payment for up to 18 months, depending on eligibility. That payment, however, according to a FEMA spokesperson, is based on the rental market in the community where the person lived at the time of the disaster, not where they are currently living.\n\nThat means a person who fled Puerto Rico for Florida would get paid a rental stipend based on the rental market in Puerto Rico, the spokesperson said, not that of Florida, which is far more expensive. The fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is $530 per month, according to a US Department of Housing and Urban Development index . In Osceola County, Florida, it's $1,096 -- more than double.\n\nThose amounts can be adjusted depending on family circumstances and other factors.\n\nAs for the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, more than 7,000 applicants have gotten motel vouchers as part of the Hurricane Maria recovery, according to FEMA. About 2,700 applicants still were staying in motels as of mid-April, nearly seven months later, according to Byrne, the FEMA official in Puerto Rico. Nearly 40% of those current residents are in Florida.\n\nIn all, FEMA has spent $64.4 million on the motel program for Maria victims.\n\nIt's critical that disaster survivors find a sense of normalcy as quickly as possible, experts say.\n\n\"Just like a shelter is not intended to be a long-term solution for somebody, a hotel room ... was never intended to be a long-term solution,\" said Byrne, the FEMA official. \"What we work hard at is to provide overarching case management to these families ... to help them find a way back into their home (in Puerto Rico).\"\n\nHe added, \"I don't think anybody wants to stay in a hotel. ... It gets old fast. Imagine if you had your whole family with you in a one-room hotel. We want to try to find another solution for those people (who are still living in hotels) as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWithout more transitional help, however, hurricane victims \"fall off a cliff\" when they're booted from motels, said Rodriguez, the Episcopal priest in Orlando. \"Stop kicking this can down the road and just give them permanent housing,\" he said. \"There needs to be a game plan. It's a waste of taxpayer money to be dumping money into hotel stays.\"\n\nThe whiplash of the threatened voucher cutoffs and last-minute extensions causes unnecessary turmoil for disaster survivors, he said. \"We have three weeks for people to find homes,\" he said, referring to the May 14 FEMA cutoff. \"They lost a week in panic, now we have three weeks to find them homes. How are we going to house over 1,000 people?\"\n\n\"We still have these families who are going to have to vacate before the end of the school year,\" he added.\n\nThe fact that the Direct Lease program -- which can provide housing for 18 months or sometimes longer -- is offered in Puerto Rico, but not in Florida, has been criticized by US Rep. Darren Soto, a Democrat who represents Kissimmee and central Florida.\n\n\"This could have been done far more humanely if the Trump administration would have approved long-term lease vouchers,\" Soto told CNN. \"It would have allowed these people to save up enough money for a deposit and live in a far more humane environment.\n\n\"It's not a priority for the White House to have these (longer-term housing programs) approved,\" Soto said. \"Otherwise it easily would have been done.\"\n\nFEMA officials have said repeatedly that they're handling Hurricane Maria's recovery as they would any other storm of this magnitude, regardless of the fact that Puerto Rico is not a US state, does not have voting members in the US Congress -- and that its residents can't vote for president.\n\nBaby Valentina was born on April 2 while her family was living in the Super 8, her father said.\n\nChris Currie, director of emergency management issues at the US Government Accountability Office, said there are no rules barring FEMA from offering longer-term Direct Lease assistance in Florida.\n\n\"I don't see anything in the guidance or statutes that restricts where they could purchase or lease units for direct housing assistance,\" Currie said. \"There is nothing that would just absolutely bar them from that.\n\n\"Whether they decide to use it -- or it makes sense -- is a whole other story.\"\n\n'Hola! T\u00fa eres Boricua?'\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Millie and a friend visited evacuee motels up and down US Highway 192 in Kissimmee. They wanted to raise awareness about a job fair and rally hosted by the group Vamos4PR , which, like the Hispanic Federation Latino Leadership, Inc. , and others, has been trying to help Puerto Rican evacuees in central Florida.\n\nOn one of the stops, she pulled into the Radisson parking lot and hollered out the window of her blue minivan: \"Hola! T\u00fa eres Boricua?\" she asked. Are you Puerto Rican?\n\nYes, a young mother, Raysha Vargas, answered.\n\nHer daughter, age 2, walked across a yellow speedbump in the hotel parking lot.

Though he never joined the ranks of the Nazi Party, Asperger sought membership in several organizations affiliated with it, the study claims.\n\nThe research is based on Asperger's personnel files, political assessments by Nazi authorities and contemporary medical records from various institutions.\n\n\"The picture that emerges is that of a man who managed to further his career under the Nazi regime, despite his apparent political and ideological distance from it,\" Czech writes.\n\nThe reassessment of Asperger's role in history is likely to prompt intense discussion among people with autism and their families, according to Carol Povey, director at the National Autistic Society's Centre of Autism in the UK. \"We expect these findings to spark a big conversation among the 700,000 autistic people in the UK and their family members, particularly those who identify with the term 'Asperger,' \" Povey said.\n\n\"We will be listening closely to the response to this news so we can continue to make sure the language we use to describe autism reflects the preferences of autistic people and their families.\n\n\"Obviously, no one with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome should feel in any way tainted by this very troubling history.\"\n\nThe term Asperger's syndrome was coined in London in 1981 by Dr. Lorna Wing to describe a high-functioning form of autism characterized by average or above average intelligence and a difficulty socializing and communicating with others.\n\nThe editors of Molecular Autism, in an editorial accompanying the study , state that at the time, Wing was \"unaware of Hans Asperger's close alliance with, and support of, the Nazi program of compulsory sterilization and euthanasia.\"\n\n'Permanent placement'\n\nOne particularly upsetting case cited by Czech is that of Herta Schreiber, a 3-year-old patient with signs of disturbed mental and physical development who also had encephalitis.\n\nIn 1941, Asperger recommended Herta's transferal to Spiegelgrund, saying \"permanent placement\" there was \"absolutely necessary\" because she must \"an unbearable burden to her mother.\"\n\nHerta died three months after acceptance in the clinic, one day after her third birthday. A note in the child's Spiegelgrund file indicated that her mother knew what fate awaited her child.\n\nAt least one expert said the report still needs to be seen in context.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Virtually all doctors in Germany at that time were members of the Nazi Party, and there was almost no opposition to the euthanasia programs for the mentally ill and handicapped, except from one or two heads of asylums and a very small number of Catholic bishops,\" said Dr. Anthony J. Bailey, professor and chairman of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Institute of Mental Health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.\n\n\"The truth is that forced euthanasia was imposed on a very diverse range of people with mental and neurological problems, and a focus on Asperger seems unwarranted,\" Bailey said."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/health/winter-ice-swimming-sweden-sport-fit-nation/index.html", "published": "2018-04-20T09:35:58", "title": "Ice swim racing is not for the faint of heart -- literally", "text": "(CNN) Plunge into water at near-freezing temperatures, and your body goes into extreme distress. Your skin screams signals of pain. You can't breathe, because your chest is cramping up. Talking is nearly impossible. Your heart is pounding. Fear mounts -- as it should. Without any protection, you may lose consciousness in under 15 minutes. You'll be dead within an hour.\n\nOr ... you can start racing! That's the idea behind the Open Scandinavian Championship in Winter Swimming , which takes place every year in a 25-meter pool cut out of a frozen lake in a small Swedish town only about 100 miles from the Arctic Circle. Nearly 400 swimmers traveled there in February for the privilege and thrill of competing in this unique sport with as many health benefits as risks, it seems.\n\nIt's the health benefits of the cold -- both physical and emotional -- that inspired this winter swimming race in the first place. Lars Westerlund, a founder and current organizer of the race, is also the chairman of the Society for Happy Friends of Cold and Darkness, dedicated to embracing the sub-zero temperatures and sub-sunshine days of the region. The Happy Friends want to give travelers reasons to venture that far north.\n\nTheirs is a yin and yang understanding of darkness and cold. It's actually the light of a region so dark in the winter that is amazing: the long blueish dawn of a three-hour day and the unique way light reflects off the snow. And it's the health benefits of cold that are the attraction, particularly for winter swimming.\n\nWhen racers come out of the water, \"they are very happy,\" said Lars Westerlund, a founder and organizer of the race. \"It's like taking a joint.

There's not a lot of published research on the topic, but one recent study found that individuals who regularly took cold showers reported fewer sick days than warm-water bathers.\n\nThere is some evidence that cold water exposure builds immunity, but it's not conclusive. It's also not clear whether cold water therapy, as it is called, burns more calories, though one former NASA scientist swears that it's helped him drop 30 pounds . Westerlund has extended an invitation to a professor who's been measuring the increase of brown (i.e. good) fat among his cold-water dipping students at the Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden.\n\nThere is some scientific evidence that cold water can help fight off stress, depression and insomnia , though. Endorphins -- hormones created in the brain and nervous system -- are released in the body when it hits cold water; they reduce pain and are considered a natural antidepressant.\n\n\"I was surprised to learn just how good I felt afterward,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said of his own jump into cold water 270 miles north of the Arctic Circle. He was with hypothermia expert Dr. Mads Gilbert, who told him \"that my body had just released more endorphins than a warm water swim, explaining the 'cold water high,' and additionally my metabolic activity was higher, allowing me to burn away more fat.\"\n\nThe psychological benefit of winter swimming may be related to conquering one's fear in face of pain and life-threatening conditions. Plunging into cold water also induces Zen. \"You empty your brain,\" Westerlund said of the experience. \"It's just survival.\"\n\nBut the greatest joy may be the feeling of getting out of the water and getting warm again. The juxtaposition leaves people feeling energized, giddy and even serene for hours afterward.\n\n\"When I come up, after swallowing half the river and with the beard full of icelings, it is a lot of laughing, primal screaming and cursing,\" said swimmer Enar Nordvik of northern Sweden, who was a on a team with co-workers. \"Like walking to your own execution but becoming free.\"\n\nWesterlund says that \"the people who have never done it before are very tense. But when they come out of the water they are very happy. It's like taking a joint. Everything is in harmony. It's a very special experience.\"\n\nThere are serious health risks to cold water immersion, of course. Hypothermia can kill you. Panic can lead to drowning, especially in open water. Swimming below surface ice carries a high risk of being trapped underneath. Swimmers looking to take up the icy waters should consult their doctors, as the sport could be fatal for someone with a heart condition.\n\nIf you add racing to the mix, there is the additional thrill of competition. There's also less risk of dying with organizers and a fully equipped emergency diver on hand. It helps that most of the racers are out of the water in less than two minutes.\n\nIce, ice, baby\n\nThe first year of the Open Scandinavian, in 2012, 32 swimmers came from five countries to Skellefte\u00e5, Sweden, to compete. The town of 42,000 people is quite remote, a nine- to 10-hour drive from the capital, Stockholm. Skellefte\u00e5 is surrounded by pine and fir trees as far as the eye can see.\n\n\"At the beginning, people thought we were just crazy,\" Westerlund said. The outside temperature for that first competition was minus 36 degrees Celsius (minus 32.8 Fahrenheit).\n\nThis year, it was a balmy minus 10 degrees C (14 F). But the temperature in the River Skellefte is about the same every year they race: 0.2 C (32 F) degrees this February. To be clear, that's 0.2 degrees shy of the water turning into ice.\n\nThe ice on the surface, more than 2 feet thick, had been cut by a team of laborers with chainsaws. It took a week, but we're told that, unlike the opening of the hit Disney movie \"Frozen,\" there was no singing that accompanied the ice cutting.\n\nThe first organized winter swim competition took place in Finland in the 1980s, and it has been gaining glacial traction. The Swedish race is now one of five winter swimming competitions in the World International Winter Swimming Association World Cup -- along with other host countries Russia, Lithuania, Estonia and Great Britain -- between October and March. There is a world championship race every other year, and the association is pursuing Winter Olympics dreams.\n\nSweden may also be the coldest of the championship races, with only Russia giving it a run for that superlative. Winter swimming has a longer tradition in Finland and Russia, but this race is the first of kind in Sweden, beginning a tradition and putting a unique spin on it.\n\nIn past years, there have been lectures on cold and darkness, snow-angel making and \"child curling,\" in which kids ball themselves up and are slid toward targets on the ice.\n\nThis year, there was a poetry contest. Artists moved by a love of the cold recited their verse while treading in the near-freezing river. A winner was declared, but alas, her poem has not been translated into English.\n\nOn the day of the race, nearly 400 swimmers from 21 countries made their way to the 25-meter natural ice swimming pool from the changing area inside City Hall, on the banks of the river. After the races, they went back into the building for a disco dance party at which reindeer was served for dinner.\n\nMany swimmers were sporting creative and/or funny hats to compete for the best hat award. Hundreds more came out to watch and cheer for them from the water's edge.\n\n\"It is a beautiful cold place with very warm people around\" is how Christof Wandratsch of Germany described the scene.\n\nThe race day consisted of three individual races: a 25-meter breaststroke, freestyle and butterfly, a 50-meter breaststroke and freestyle, and a 100-meter freestyle. Races are grouped by age, a range this year of swimmers born as recently as 2004 and as long ago as 1940. A fourth race was a relay with teams of four (with at least one member of a different gender than the others), each doing a single lap. With more than 40 teams, the co-ed team race was the most popular.\n\nThe fastest lap was completed in 12.89 seconds by Rauno P\u00e4rg of Estonia. Silver, gold and bronze medals were awarded to those with the fastest times, but there's no prize money. The more professional racers have sponsors, but the race is also open to newcomers. Some were there because a loved one (or nemesis?) gave them an entry spot as a gift.\n\nSwimmers can't drink alcohol before a competition, or have the flu that day. They can't wear wetsuits, gloves or any footgear. But all of them must wear a hat, for body heat retention. This year, one of the swimmers won recognition for best hat, in the shape of downtown Skellefte\u00e5 landmarks.\n\nTaking the big plunge\n\nIf you want to get into the sport, talk to your doctor, even if you are already active and a good swimmer. Then find safe places to swim, public areas with other swimmers year-round. Westerlund suggests starting your winter swimming training in warmer months so that you become acclimated to the cold as the seasons change. Even taking regular cold showers helps prepare you for race day.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe ability to swim in cold weather is as much about physical fitness and learning how to breathe quickly to fill your lungs as it is about training yourself psychologically to do something painful and panic-inducing.

The couple was planning to move to Morocco to start a new, cheaper life, she says, and needed to go through Hong Kong to transfer money.\n\nDays later, Sally says, she stood on the Turkish border with Syria, on the edge of ISIS territory, her husband holding her daughter, Sarah, while she held her son, Matthew, then 7, confronted with an impossible choice: Abandon her daughter to ISIS and save her son, or follow her husband into ISIS's so-called Caliphate. Following him was the only way to protect her daughter, she says.\n\n\"To stay there with my son or watch my daughter leave with my husband -- I had to make a decision,\" Sally, 32, tells CNN in northern Syria.\n\n\"Maybe I would never have seen my daughter again ever, and how can I live the rest of my life like that.\"\n\nSamantha Sally speaks to CNN in northern Syria with her children.\n\nSally spoke to CNN in Syrian-Kurdish custody, in limbo, arrested after ISIS's collapse in Raqqa and unsure if she will ever see the United States again.\n\nThe story of how Sally got there is a remarkable web of mystery, compassion, and animal savagery befitting ISIS's legacy of almost surreal terror. And in it, Sally flits between the role of naive, manipulated housewife, and the savvy pragmatist able to survive the savage, male-dominated world of ISIS.\n\nAs she sits in a Syrian-Kurdish jail, waiting the US government to determine -- or not determine -- what to do with her, it is navigating that delicate balance between unknowing victim and deft manipulator that will decide her fate.\n\n'I was like a prisoner'\n\nSally's journey to the former Caliphate begins in Elkhart, Indiana, where she and Elhassani worked at a delivery company. They lived with Matthew, her son from her first marriage to a US soldier, and their daughter Sarah.\n\nElhassani took delight in souped-up cars, family videos show, and, according to Sally, used drugs and cheated on her -- showing few signs of devout faith. Their marriage was rocky at times, but Elhassani came up with a plan to move to his native Morocco for a year, where she could get cheap surgery on her knee and they might find a new start.\n\nShe says she went ahead to look, and was impressed enough to later fly to Hong Kong and help transfer some of their money. From Hong Kong, the couple together went to Turkey, on what Sally says was a romantic holiday, during which Elhassani lavished her with gifts.\n\nA Facebook image from 2013 shows Samantha Sally, right, with Moussa Elhassani.\n\nAt the time, the indirect trip to Asia before diverting to the Syrian border in Turkey, and the proxy transfer of funds to Hong Kong, were textbook methods of evading law enforcement for those seeking to join ISIS. But Sally insists she thought nothing was amiss before she reached the Turkish border town of Sanliurfa.\n\nIt was there that Elhassani refused to let her leave the hotel room, saying the city was \"too dangerous.\"\n\n\"Once we got to Sanliurfa everything changed,\" she says. \"I was like a prisoner in the room.\"\n\nPushed as to how a woman adequately assertive to divorce her first husband in her 20s was now so submissive in a bustling Turkish city, she said: \"This was years in the making. He separated me from my family. I could not see that he was the one that was wrong. It was always 'no, my husband is right.'\"\n\nDays later, they found themselves on the border, Sally faced with the agonizing choice. She insists the crossing was forced and then felt she could have come back again to Turkey later.\n\n\"People can think whatever they want but they have not been put in a place to make a decision like that,\" she says.\n\nBuying slaves at a market\n\nInside the so-called Caliphate, her relationship with Elhassani changed. \"Before he would spoil me. 'I love you.' We were very much in love. The romance never left. As soon as we came here it changed. I was a dog. I didn't have any choice. He was extremely violent. And there was nothing I could do about it. Nothing.\"\n\nSally says she feared divorcing him as that would leave her and her children yet more vulnerable in ISIS's society. She said at one point she was jailed by ISIS for three months while pregnant for trying to escape and for alleged espionage for the US.\n\nShe says she was held in solitary confinement and tortured, even sexually abused, in that jail. Sally says she was later released and went back to the small home she had made for her family on the outskirts of Raqqa, where Elhassani would periodically return from the frontline and -- in between fits of violence -- fathered two children by her.\n\nThe loneliness of her domestic existence made Elhassani propose an addition to their home, which was, by the warped standards of the Caliphate, commonplace. In 2014, the terror group had captured hundreds of Yazidis when it took Mount Sinjar in Iraq, and many of the younger women were being sold as slaves, some purely for the purposes of sexual abuse.\n\nElhassani suggested some Yazidi slaves would help keep Sally company while he was away, and he took her to the slave market. There she saw Soad.\n\n\"When I met Soad, I couldn't think about money, I needed to help her,\" she said. The teenage girl cost her $10,000 -- half the money she says she smuggled with her from their United States savings. She brought Soad home, and soon, her husband Elhassani began raping her.\n\nSamantha Sally had two more children with Moussa Elhassani in Syria.\n\nBut that was not enough. Elhassani soon decided to \"buy\" his own slave, using another $7,500 from their savings to purchase Bedrine, who was younger than Soad. She was also raped by Elhassani. The family also bought a young boy, Aham, for $1,500 later still.\n\nSally is defensive about the decision to buy the girls, saying she offered them a protection and care that other homes could not have.\n\n\"I was trying to hold on to that money as at some point I knew that he (Elhassani) was going to die and I was going to need that money. That wasn't the plan.\"\n\nAsked if she feels she enabled the girls' serial rape, she said: \"In every house that she was in before that was the same situation, but she did not have the support of someone like me. We constantly talked about going to see her mother. I was going to get her out and she was going to go back home.\"\n\nSally continued: \"And no, no one will ever know what it is like to watch their husband rape a 14-year-old girl. Ever. And then she comes to you -- me -- after crying and I hold her and tell her it's going to be OK. Everything is going to be fine, just be patient.\"\n\n\"I would never apologize for bringing those girls to my house. They had me and I had them. And we knew that if we were just patient we would stick together. You understand? In any other situation they would be locked in a bedroom and fed tea every day. And the situation I was in with them, we cooked together, we cleaned together. Drank coffee together. Slept in the same room together. I was like their mother.\"\n\nTwo broken ribs\n\nSally does not outwardly appear a devout ISIS wife. She has a large blue tattoo of pursed lips on the right side of her neck and a nose ring. She smokes, and appears defiantly dismissive of the suggestion she must have known more about her husband's plans to join the Caliphate than she admits. Indeed, she has been interviewed by the FBI, and admitting to voluntarily joining ISIS would legally complicate her situation, if not result in charges.\n\nCNN has spoken to several friends from her hometown, who say there were no open signs of her radicalization, and depict a loyal, single divorcee who found in Elhassani a generous provider-turned-controlling abuser.\n\n\"She was an amazing, wonderful, generous person, a really good friend and an excellent mom to Matt and Sarah,\" says friend Andria Lightner.\n\n\"I believe with all my heart she would never be willing to take her kids\" to join ISIS.\n\nA close friend in Indiana, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sally became less available before she left and curiously did not confide in her friends that she intended to move to Morocco.\n\nShe quit her job, and declared she was going on vacation to Hong Kong, but the friend describes what would be their final farewell as ordinary: \"It was 'I can't wait for you to be home and see you soon,'\" the friend says. \"She was being everyday normal Sam.\"\n\nA Facebook photo of Samantha Sally posted in 2014.\n\nCNN also tracked down Soad, the older of the three Yazidi children Sally and Elhassani bought. Now 17, she is in a refugee camp in Iraq, reunited with her family, and has nothing but gratitude for the American housewife who purchased her into a life of repeated rape. She sent a video message to Sally in which she said: \"I really want to see you, even if it is one last time. I miss you so much and I miss your children. Anything I can do to help you get out, I will do. I love you so much.\"\n\nIn other ways too, Sally's own children became victims. Her son Matthew, a US citizen through and through, was a prized cast member for ISIS as they increasingly sought to involve children in their macabre and sickening propaganda videos. Matthew was eventually visited by another ISIS fighter, who knew the ISIS propaganda wing, and approached Sally and Matthew with a script, part Arabic, part English, for Matthew's appearance.\n\n\"After I saw the script was when the beating happened,\" Sally said, referring to her husband. \"I was like, 'This is absolutely not acceptable'. All I could do was talk. He became very violent and scared my son into becoming complicit. I ended up with two broken ribs on that video. I fought. I fought. It was three days after my operation with her,\" she says, indicating to her youngest daughter. \"I did not give birth naturally, it was Cesarean. I couldn't even fight back. There was nothing I could do.\"\n\nMatthew, sitting next to his mother throughout her interview, chimes in: \"It was a very bad beating.\"\n\nSally added: \"They learned the script but it was grueling. His days were long and he came home crying every day about how tired he was.\"\n\nThe video is one of ISIS's more notorious, in which Matthew is made to walk through a damaged mosque and streets, vow revenge on US President Donald Trump and pledge attacks on the West.\n\nHis mouth intermittently full of candy given to him by his Syrian-Kurdish captors, Matthew says: \"It was extremely stressful and it was hard. I would have to say one word and then they would make me say another in Arabic. I never even knew Arabic before. I did not want to do it. He would hit me, he would stress me. About all those things.\"\n\nAsked where he wants to go now, he said: \"Back to my state. Back to America.\"\n\nISIS a bunch of 'drug-using thugs'\n\nThe family's escape from Raqqa came tantalizingly closer when a drone strike killed Elhassani in the middle of last year. \"I was able to breathe,\" recalled Sally. \"I was like -- OK -- we can start phase two. At least now we can all breathe.\"\n\nThe US coalition in Syria slowly tightened its noose around Raqqa, but Sally said she saw no avenue to escape with the thousands of civilians who had been fleeing the city during the assault.\n\n\"All that I knew was that if somebody tried to leave, the snipers -- which was my husband's job -- had permission to kill. So I am thinking if I try to walk out, I take the risk of IEDS (mines) if I go off road, and I run the risk that I will be sniped.\"\n\nThey remained in Raqqa until the very final days, released, Sally says, as part of the final hundreds of ISIS fighters -- many foreign hardliners -- whose departure from the city was negotiated with the US-backed Syrian-Kurdish fighters besieging ISIS. She left in that convoy east, and then found her way north, where she was eventually detained.\n\nSamantha Sally said she felt like she could finally breathe when her husband was killed.\n\nSally's time in the so-called Caliphate spanned from its most brutal beginnings in 2015 until its very final moments, the totality of which, in some way, complicates her defense that she was an innocent bystander.\n\nSally said: \"I really don't care what people think and what people say. Once I left, I was extremely relieved and I was not able to breathe in three years until now. All I saw was a bunch of drug-using thugs who had no place. They created their own state here and called it in the name of God.\"\n\nYet it is the believability of her story -- that of the pliable and then abused housewife, turned savior of three child slaves -- upon which her and her children's fate surely hinges, as US authorities decide their next steps.\n\n\"I will do anything to get my kids back where they belong,\" Sally says. \"If I have to spend 15 years in prison, it's better than anything here.\"\n\nThey dream of returning home, yet the FBI agents who visit them in custody to talk, have yet to bring charges or plane tickets home.\n\n\"Me and my kids we talk about wanting to eat McDonald's,\" she said. \"We want to live a normal life again.\"\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the year Samantha Sally arrived in the so-called Caliphate."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/festo-bionic-robots/index.html", "published": "2018-04-20T12:20:21", "title": "Festo's fantastical robots inspired by animals and insects", "text": "By continuing to browse our site you agree to our use of cookies , revised Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .

Omido tells Okello to pack a few items of clothing; she needs to go to the doctor, Omido says.\n\n\"Somehow, Catherine's whole family was exposed to very high lead levels,\" Omido says of the ailing mother. \"I haven't understood why, because they weren't the ones living closest to the lead factory.\"\n\nBefore driving Okello to the hospital, Omido visits two other ailing villagers: Robert Osieko, an elderly man who recently suffered a stroke, and David Mahala, a middle-aged man whose kidneys are failing.\n\nJUST WATCHED These Kenyan villagers are suing the government for pollution Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These Kenyan villagers are suing the government for pollution 04:11\n\nOmido takes Okello to the hospital and stays with her until she's admitted. She then drives an hour north to a small coastal city, arriving at a walled compound where she's taken refuge since November. She's hiding here, she says, while a lawsuit she filed against the Kenyan government and the smelter owners works its way through the court system.\n\nShe undoes the three locks on her front door and disarms the security system, setting down her purse, which houses a small black GPS tracker resembling a beeper; she carries it with her wherever she goes.\n\n\"There's been a lot of security challenges,\" she would later say. \"Any time we go to court, we come under attack.\"\n\n\"Life-or-death situation\"\n\nPhyllis Omido walks through the village of Owino Uhuru. She has been keeping a close eye on the lead exposure that has plagued this settlement since a nearby smelter began operations in 2007.\n\nOmido, 39, is one of Kenya's most outspoken environmental activists. She's been dubbed the \"East African Erin Brockovich,\" and her work has led to the shuttering of 10 toxic waste smelters in Kenya in the past three years.\n\nShe received the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize , awarded annually to six people from six different continents who undertake \"sustained and significant efforts to protect and enhance the natural environment, often at great personal risk.\"\n\nIndeed, much of Omido's work has been at great risk -- to herself, her family, and her colleagues' families. She's been physically attacked multiple times and is constantly threatened. She says she's been arrested on five different occasions, but never convicted. Her colleagues' lives have also been threatened, their homes broken into or burned.\n\n\"It's quite unfortunate that we have to go through all this,\" Omido says with a small shrug.\n\nIn 2016, after Omido and a team of lawyers filed a class action lawsuit alleging the government and the lead factory owners of violating Kenyan law and several international treaties, the threats intensified.\n\nThe United Nations, through its Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a press release in April demanding the Kenyan government do more to protect Omido and her colleagues, who are \"facing a life-or-death situation.\"\n\n\"These human rights abuses undermine the ability of ordinary Kenyans to seek environmental protection without fear,\" the UN statement reads. \"It is vital that the Kenyan Government takes effective actions immediately to protect these environmental defenders.\"\n\nPolice in Mombasa began investigating the alleged threats in April, local media reported . Police chief for Mombasa County, Peter Omwana, told CNN \"the matter had been dealt with,\" while declining to provide specifics.\n\nPublic prosecutors contacted local police three times to ask for any findings, said Mary Wanjiru, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. They received no response, Wanjiru said.\n\nThick fumes, bitter water\n\nOmido never dreamed of becoming an activist, but the issue of lead poisoning became personal after her son was born.\n\nShe began work at the lead-acid battery recycling plant, Metal Refinery EPZ, as a community relations manager in 2009, the second year of the plant's operation.\n\nThe smelter exported blocks of pure lead by taking used car batteries and extracting the lead from them using a special furnace. In violation of Kenyan environmental and human rights law, the factory's smelting process would emit fumes, dust, and effluent laden with lead particles, according to a 2015 report by the Ministry of Health.\n\nPhyllis Omido meets with Catherine Okello and her son, Sammy, in 2014. They are both suffering from lead related illnesses. Both have since died from lead-related illnesses since this picture was taken.\n\nTasked with assessing the smelter's environmental impact, Omido made a grim discovery: she found the factory's location -- directly next to Owino Uhuru -- left the roughly 3,000 residents there vulnerable to lead exposure. She recommended to management the factory be relocated, and was dismissed from the project, she says.\n\nThree months into her job, Omido's infant son, King David, starting vomiting frequently, his fever spiking daily. Omido brought him to the hospital, where tests for malaria, typhoid, and rotavirus all came back negative.\n\nStumped, Omido acted on a co-worker's recommendation she test her son for lead poisoning. His blood came back positive for lead at a rate of 35 micrograms per deciliter. Anything above 5 micrograms per deciliter is concerning, according to the Center for Diseases Control. Her doctor told her King David had likely ingested lead through her breast milk.\n\nOmido showed her son's test results to a manager at work and was given a check for her son's medical bills on the verbal agreement that she would not go public with her findings, she says. She took the money and quit.\n\nConcerned other children were being affected, Omido then tested the lead levels of three children from Owino Uhuru. All tests came back positive for lead, at 12, 17, and 23 micrograms per deciliter.\n\nMeanwhile, villagers were suffering the smelter's toxic effects. At night, the factory spewed thick, black smoke from its chimneys. Owino Uhuru residents said they would sometimes have to sleep outside to avoid choking on the fumes that would waft through their windows and become trapped in their homes. Factory emissions would also cause acid rain, mixing into the soil and eating through villagers' corrugated metal roofs.\n\n\"We used to get rain water from the roofs,\" explains Owino Uhuru resident Rose Obuya. \"We used to use it for domestic consumption -- drinking, cooking, bathing -- but all of a sudden, we realized that the rain water has a bitter taste. It wasn't normal.\"\n\nVillagers also noticed a brown, cloudy effluent being released from underneath the factory wall. The liquid would flow downhill through the village and gather at a small body of stagnant water where children played and residents would draw their water.\n\nAbdominal pain, dizziness, diarrhea, coughing and fatigue became common complaints among Owino Uhuru residents. Children and adults began developing large, scaly skin rashes. Several women began to miscarry, sometimes repeatedly.\n\nLinet Nabwire, a villager who spoke to CNN-affiliate KTN in 2015 for a documentary about lead poisoning in Owino Uhuru, recalled suffering three miscarriages after testing positive for lead.\n\n\"I am scared, I fear the same thing will happen again,\" Nabwire told the reporter.\n\nNabwire later died while giving birth to a baby boy. A post-mortem exam shows her blood lead level was tested the year before at a startling 238 micrograms per deciliter.\n\nOthers would also die. Catherine Okello, before falling ill, lost her 10-month-old son Victor to lead poisoning. Her other son, five-year-old Sammy, also died; his blood lead level was 13 micrograms per deciliter.\n\nAltogether, Omido says she's recorded 79 deaths in Owino Uhuru from lead-related ailments, including 46 children. She also recorded 124 miscarriages between 2010 and 2014, when the smelter was in operation.\n\nCNN could not independently verify these numbers.\n\nIn 2015, the government conducted blood tests on 50 Owino Uhuru residents. All residents tested positive for the presence of lead, and half of them had blood lead levels deemed dangerous by the Center for Disease Control. According to the World Health Organization, there is no known safe level of exposure to lead.\n\n\"Standing up to men\"\n\nAfter leaving the smelter as an employee, Omido began urging Owino Uhuru residents to write letters to public health officials. Their letters met with no response, she says. To better organize her efforts, she created the Center for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action\n\nIn 2010, after a factory worker fainted and died, Omido organized a demonstration. She stood with other villagers outside the gates of the factory, hoisting signs and crying out \"lead kills,\" when parliamentary member Ramadhan Kajembe, then the Assistant Minister for Environment, arrived at the scene.\n\nAfter the smelter began its operations, several of the village's children started having complications with their skin, developing large patchy rashes.\n\n\"He said the smelter had created jobs for the community,\" Omido recalls. She says he publicly accused her of trying to incite community members. She threatened to show him her son's lab test results, certified by the city's chief medical examiner.\n\n\"And at that point he ordered his bodyguards to clobber me,\" she says with a small, amused smile. \"So, I climbed on a motorbike and escaped.\"\n\nKajembe told CNN he did not remember the incident.\n\nAfter the first protest, the National Environment Management Authority ordered the smelter to close, citing the factory's lack of compliance with safety requirements. The factory was shuttered temporarily, but quickly reopened after the Municipal Council of Mombasa decided the factory had complied with its requirements. The letter-writing campaign continued.\n\nOmido decided to stage another demonstration in 2012. \"By then, the number of sick people had gone very high,\" she says. \"People were not able to be productive anymore, not able to go to work because they were exposed to very thick smoke all night.\"\n\nOmido was arrested early that morning before the demonstration could get underway. She stayed in jail overnight and eventually stood trial, accused of inciting violence and unlawfully assembling -- \"trumped up charges,\" according to Human Rights Watch\n\nAt trial, a prosecutor argued that Omido was carrying a firearm the day of the demonstration, Omido claims. After police were unable to provide evidence of this, an officer took the stand to testify. \"He said the most dangerous weapon I had was my mouth,\" Omido recalls with a laugh. \"And that when I spoke to community members, they would do what I said, so that should be considered a weapon.\"\n\nOmido was acquitted. She would be arrested four more times. Each time, she was held overnight, never charged, and eventually released.\n\nLater that year, while still living in Mombasa, she returned home one evening with her son to find two armed men at her gate. One of the men hit her in the back of the head with the barrel of his gun, causing her to fall. King David, now a toddler, began to cry. From the ground, she begged them to let her take her son inside. They agreed. She came back outside and they hit her again, knocking her briefly unconscious. One of her neighbors then pulled up to the gate in his car. In the flash of his headlights, the men fled.\n\n\"The only thing I could remember they said was that I was an arrogant person and that I was trying to stand up to men in the society,\" she recalls. \"So that stuck with me. I knew this was about Owino Uhuru. This was not a normal robbery.\"\n\nShe immediately fled Mombasa and relocated to a small coastal town, where she continued her advocacy work.\n\nFollowing a third demonstration in 2013, NEMA again ordered the smelter to be closed. Three weeks after it shut down, smoke emissions again billowed from the factory's chimneys. Only in 2014, after Kenya made exporting scrap metal illegal did the factory permanently close.\n\nOwino Uhuru goes to court\n\n\"At least, now, the air was clean. But the soil and water were still contaminated,\" Omido said of the factory's closing. So began her mission to get the affected residents of Owino Uhuru compensated for their suffering.\n\nIn 2015, a government taskforce concluded Metal Refinery EPZ \"failed to balance its economic interest against public health interest and environmental concerns.\"\n\n\"By releasing toxic fumes containing lead particulates and oxides of sulphur, trade effluent, and solid waste into the neighboring Owino Uhuru village ... the factory primarily caused the myriad of problems threatening public health and safety of Owino Uhuru,\" the taskforce report reads\n\nThe chimneys of a lead smelting factory loom over the village of Owino Uhuru. The factory spewed lead-laden smoke and effluent into the village, in and off, from 2007-2014.\n\nCNN's efforts to reach the factory owners were unsuccessful. Omido's lawyer went to Mumbai, where Metal Refinery EPZ is based, and tried to serve both men with papers, Omido says. He couldn't find either of them.\n\nHezron Awiti, a member of parliament who has admitted to owning the factory premises to local media, refused to comment to CNN. An article in the local paper, The Standard, says Awiti denied knowledge of the factory's activities, and has blamed health officials for failing to enforce safety standards.\n\n\"As a landlord I was not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company, neither did I have the expertise to determine, at the earliest stage possible, that sinister activities, with highly dangerous outcome were going on in the premises,\" he said to The Standard.\n\nThe taskforce report found that \"the situation in Owino Uhuru settlements and its environs became what it is today because the various legislative frameworks were not strictly adhered to.\"\n\n\"Lack of good waste management practices by both factory management and relevant government agencies greatly contributed to lead exposure within the factory premises and its immediate environs,\" the report adds.\n\nThe report recommends, among other things, cleaning up the environment of Owino Uhuru and providing medical treatment to those affected. None of those recommendations were implemented, Omido says. She felt the only option was to go to court.\n\nShe gathered a handful of Owino Uhuru residents who were exhibiting signs of lead poisoning. Such as Kelvin Musyoka, a young boy whose leg began to rot after he stepped into a puddle of contaminated sludge, Omido says. She named them in a class action suit against the government and the companies associated with the factory. Once a public notice of the case was published in a local newspaper, Omido says the threats increased.\n\nShe would receive text messages from unknown numbers, demanding she stop the lawsuit from moving forward. Three Owino Uhuru residents who worked closely with Omido -- Anastacia Nambo, Wilifred Kamenchu, and Alfred Ogola, also were threatened. Nambo says her home was broken into. Both Kamenchu and Ogola say their houses were set on fire. Today, Nambo and Ogola both carry the same GPS tracker as Omido.\n\nLast year in April, as Omido was boarding a flight to Johannesburg to attend an environmental summit, she received a phone call from an unknown number. \"Where is your son?\" a strange voice on the other line demanded.\n\n\"Why do you want to know where my son is?\" she asked the stranger.\n\n\"He's in danger,\" said the voice, and then a click. Silence.\n\nPanicked, Omido called a friend and begged her to pick up King David from school and take him to Nairobi, where he would be relatively safe.\n\nThe next day, Omido heard Kamenchu's son was kidnapped on his way home from school. He turned up three days later, unharmed.\n\n\"But still the threats were still coming,\" Kamenchu said.\n\nPresently, Omido has a variety of security precautions in place.\n\nHer office and home are decked out with closed-circuit television cameras. She owns 10 dogs, five of which she trains as attack dogs; the other five are trained to detect explosives. She closely monitors her son's whereabouts. To keep her siblings out of danger, she won't tell them where she lives. She's developed tracking and evacuation procedures, signals, safe words to be used during emergencies.\n\n\"Mostly I pray, even though I take a lot of precautions,\" she says.\n\nA normal life\n\nMombasa Governor Hassan Joho admits the government needs to do more to address the suffering in Owino Uhuru. He blamed the inaction on the country's switch in 2013 from a municipal council to a county government system.\n\n\"There was a bit of laxity at that time,\" he said to CNN. \"But now we can't blame the municipality. It is no longer there.\"\n\nTo his credit, the county has covered some Owino Uhuru residents' medical bills accrued from lead-related illnesses. For six months, the county offered village members zinc and calcium supplement, which can decrease lead concentration in the blood.\n\nPhyllis Omido receiving the prestigious Goldman Environment Prize in 2015.\n\nBut many medical bills have gone unpaid, Omido says. And several Owino Uhuru residents told CNN that Mombasa County's distribution of calcium and zinc, which counteract lead toxicity, abruptly stopped in September 2016; the government claims it is ongoing.\n\n\"They brought calcium and zinc for just a short period,\" said Anastacia Nambo, a colleague of Omido. \"Some were given maybe once. Myself, I got it once, but my child never received it. Others have still never received it.\"\n\nLead-acid batteries -- used in cars, energy supplies, and solar power storage -- are improperly recycled in many developing countries, according to environmental non-profit Pure Earth.\n\nIn countries with strictly enforced regulations, special equipment must be used in smelters to curb environmental pollution. At lead smelters in the United States, for instance, filtration devices are required for pollution control. Kenyan law says it's illegal to pollute the country's air and water, but it does not specify how a lead smelter must comply with those laws.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, collection and recycling of lead-acid batteries \"lack even basic precaution measures to prevent the emission of lead and battery acid to the workspace and the environment,\" according to a report by German environmental research firm Oko-Institut. Cases of lead-poisoning from unsound lead-acid battery recycling have been recorded in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Cameroon, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere, the report adds.\n\nIn 2015, anti-pollution watchdog Pure Earth put out a statement that claimed the improper recycling of lead-acid batteries to be one of the leading cause of lead poisoning worldwide.\n\n\"Large as these numbers are, they are almost certainly underestimates,\" the statement reads.\n\nPhyllis Omido and her son, King David, stand with their dogs. Omido owns 10 dogs, five of which she trains as attack dogs.\n\nAfter Omido brought Catherine Okello, into the hospital, doctors diagnosed the 35-year-old mother with renal failure -- a symptom of chronic lead poisoning, according to the CDC -- and prescribed kidney dialysis. In March, she died of organ failure. David Mahala, one of the other villagers Omido visited that day, would also die. His home shared a wall with the smelter.\n\nAs for the lawsuit, court proceedings have been delayed eight times. But Omido keeps hope the judge will rule in their favor -- and soon. She wants the residents of Owino Uhuru to be compensated for their suffering. But she also wants to move on with her life.\n\nShe's tired of living in hiding, she says, and would like to retire early. Maybe move to a remote farm somewhere and raise goats and cows, she adds.\n\n\"My son hasn't had much of a childhood,\" Omido says somberly. \"He can never be alone; he can be pulled out of school at any minute. He doesn't have a normal life. And isn't that what everyone deserves?\""}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/health/weed-101/index.html", "published": "2018-04-20T08:59:26", "title": "Universities meet growing demand with Weed 101", "text": "(CNN) As the first executive director and general manager of the city of Los Angeles' Department of Cannabis Regulation, Cat Packer will lay the legal foundation for how the United States' second-largest city handles marijuana. But it wasn't until three years ago, in her last semester of law school, that she even knew what she wanted to do professionally.\n\nThat's when she took a life-changing law class on marijuana.\n\n\"I will admit, before taking the class, I was completely oblivious to the many interesting conversations happening around the country about this subject,\" Packer said.\n\nA growing number of students across the United States have taken some of the country's first marijuana-themed university classes and found nearly instant success with this unique knowledge.\n\n\"Think about it: If you graduated from law school 10 years ago, you couldn't study this, because the reforms hadn't happened yet,\" said Douglas Berman , the Robert J. Watkins/Procter & Gamble Professor of Law and the creator of Packer's Marijuana Law, Policy & Reform Seminar at Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law.\n\nBerman is proud of Packer, but when he started the course in 2013, not all students were as enthusiastic as she. Some said they didn't enroll out of concern that future employers wouldn't like it, according to Berman.\n\nAs marijuana has become more mainstream, his class now fills quickly. And even if students don't go into the field like Packer did, with medical marijuana legal in more than half of the United States and recreational pot legal in nine, chances are that what they learn will come in handy.\n\n\"And with all that heat in this space on this still controversial topic, I try to emphasize, lawyers should be bringing more light, rather than heat, to these conversations, armed with the facts,\" Berman said.\n\nThe facts about marijuana are still at the center of the debate, because while states are more permissive, federal law still puts marijuana in the same category as heroin: a Schedule I drug with \"no currently accepted medical use,\" at least in the eyes of the federal government.\n\nThat leaves researchers and universities offering classes in uncharted waters.\n\nDespite the limits, a handful of determined professors have stepped up, without textbooks or well-trod academic territory, and created courses to try to ensure that the next generation is prepared to match the public's interest. There seems to be only one \"weed major,\" the medicinal plant chemistry program at Northern Michigan University, but a growing number of weed-themed classes are being offered on campuses across the country in law, business, medicine and general science.\n\nDemand outpaces science\n\nMarijuana is legal in its recreational and medicinal forms in Washington, and with more legal access comes a public desire for more education. But unless your doctor is in his or her late 90s and can remember before 1942, when it was legal to prescribe cannabis, more than likely they learned nothing about its benefits in medical school.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can help patients make good decisions,\" Carlini said. \"People won't wait for these things to resolve federally.\"\n\nThe elective focuses on how cannabis and cannabinoids impact the body. It also looks at physiological impact, therapeutic values and history. It's the first class of its kind in the University of California system.\n\nLin, an associate professor who usually teaches medical students, didn't know what to expect from her 55 undergraduates. \"I've been quite impressed by their commitment,\" she said.\n\nShe hopes her class will inspire future research. \"Just knowing what we know, and the limitations of what we know, should inspire students, and they in turn could do research that would be really helpful in this field.\"\n\nJam-packed\n\nDr. Kalev Freeman, an emergency room physician, and Monique McHenry, a botanist, helped create these courses to address several needs. Freeman said he's seen too many people taken off ambulances after overdosing on opioids, and he hopes to offer information about a \"safer alternative to the public.\" McHenry wanted to find a topic attractive to \"young minds to get them interested in science.\"\n\nTheir classes focus on basic science, the drug's physiology, molecular biology and chemistry. The professional training also drills down on practical issues like effective dosing, delivery methods and drug interactions.\n\n\"The more we can do to focus on getting evidence-based facts out to more medical professionals and the public, the more we will have a real success,\" McHenry said.\n\nFreeman agreed: \"It's a disservice to the public if professionals aren't equipped with this knowledge.\"\n\nThe bud business\n\nthat students in at the University of Denver are in demand, and other professors have noticed. He's gotten calls from all over the world, asking how the class works. The skillsthatstudents in Paul Seaborn' s Business of Marijuana class learnat the University of Denver are in demand, and other professors have noticed. He's gotten calls from all over the world, asking how the class works.\n\n\"People want to learn from the Colorado experience,\" Seaborn said. \"It's been fascinating to learn the pros and cons of the business in real time as state and federal laws evolve.\"\n\nUnderstanding the rules of the game is key, since those rules create a \"unique set of challenges,\" Seaborn said. His students learn about marijuana law and history, and they tackle its complicated finances, accounting, marketing and management.\n\nThe university's location presents unique opportunities because so many market pioneers live in the neighborhood and are happy to be guest speakers. Colorado was the first to legalize recreational adult marijuana use, so the industry bloomed there, creating more than 18,000 full-time jobs and generating $2.4 billion in economic activity, according to a study of the market in 2015.\n\n\"It's a rare thing to have an industry start from square one in your lifetime and grow so quickly right around you,\" Seaborn said. From his most recent class of 27, three or four students immediately went to work in the industry, and others will probably soon follow.\n\n\"There is certainly caution over an industry like this, especially with the federal legality in question, and there is still ongoing discussion and careful thought about how this works, but we want our graduates to come at this from an informed perspective,\" he said. \"The industry is not going to wait.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nPacker, the Los Angeles marijuana czar, would agree. \"We're in a real moment of transition,\" she said. \"These conversations about marijuana are incredibly complex. I found I can't have a conversation about the law without talking about health and social justice issues and enforcement issues.\"\n\nIt sounds like the perfect material for more college classes."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/festival-fashion-trends-style/index.html", "published": "2018-04-19T00:38:44", "title": "Coachella 2018: How festival fashion became generic", "text": "By continuing to browse our site you agree to our use of cookies , revised Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .

Kim has committed himself to the path of denuclearization and will now focus solely on economic growth and improving the national economy, the source said.\n\nThe North Korean leader has realized the best path forward is to normalize relations with other countries, the source added. He is finally being recognized by the international community, and this is a historic, timely opportunity, the source said.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cautiously welcomed the development. \"The only thing that is important is whether or not it will lead to the completely verified and irreversible abolition of nuclear and missiles,\" he told reporters. \"We would like to keep a close eye on it.\"\n\nHis Defense Minister, Itsunori Onodera, went one step further, saying that the suspension of nuclear and missile tests was \"insufficient\" and \"not satisfactory,\" as it did not mention Pyongyang's short- and mid-range capabilitiies -- the missiles that can reach Japan.\n\nHowever, analysts stressed caution over Kim's words, noting that Pyongyang was likely to be seeking something in return.\n\n\"The announcement is significant, but you know, whether North Korea is truly serious remains to be seen,\" said Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA North Korea analyst.\n\n\"They might be looking for freeze-for-freeze deals. They are looking for sanctions relief. So what are we going to give for this freezing of tests?\"\n\nAnalysis CNN's Will Ripley, who has reported from North Korea 17 times, says that Kim \"is trying to send the world a positive signal ahead of a potentially monumental summit with President Donald Trump. But the steps he is taking at this point are largely symbolic. Operations at missile and nuclear testing sites could easily be resumed, since North Korea has not agreed to destroy weapons or dismantle key facilities. Furthermore, nuclear weapons -- and the materials to make them -- are undoubtedly hidden at secret sites throughout North Korea that are unknown to the US and its allies. Taking more substantive steps towards denuclearization will come at a high price, far higher than 1994's Agreed Framework that promised North Korean denuclearization in exchange for light water reactors (that were never built) and heavy fuel shipments (that were often late). This announcement indicates a willingness by Kim to explore denuclearization in exchange for better economic conditions. But it won't be easy to convince him to give up the missile program that has arguably gotten him to this point, unless there are substantial incentives to do so.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Josh Pollack, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said that the news is Kim's way of announcing that his country is a fully paid-up member of the nuclear club.\n\n\"They have wanted to be seen as an arrived nuclear power for a while and one thing that the other nuclear powers don't do is test, with the exception of India and Pakistan, no one has done it since World War II, so it's a sign of immaturity to test and they're saying: 'we're technically mature now, so we don't need to (test) anymore.'\"\n\n\"They're not giving anything up, they're keeping (their weapons) and that's the message. It was wrapped in this seeming concession, but it's not really a concession. (If) they can decide to test after all they can just start doing it again.\"\n\nSix points\n\nThe change in North Korea's policy was announced to its citizens via state news agency KCNA. It published a list of six points that emphasized the country had achieved its nuclear objectives.\n\n\"We declare solemnly that we faithfully realized the nuclear weaponization\" -- The first point says the tests were carried out under its \"byungjin\" policy, a twofold strategy of investing in the economy and the nuclear program. Tests were carried out in sequential order to achieve the country's aim.\n\n\"The nuclear test site in northern area will be discarded\" -- KCNA said as of Saturday North Korea will no longer conduct nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile tests, and to \"ensure transparency\" the test site would be closed.\n\n\"(It's an) important process for global nuclear disarmament\" -- North Korea says it'll work with the international community to halt nuclear testing worldwide.\n\n\"We will never use nuclear weapons unless there is a nuclear threat or nuclear provocation to our country\" -- Nor will North Korea transfer nuclear weapons and technology, KCNA said.\n\nCommitment to \"dramatically raise people's lives\" -- Development of a \"strong socialist economy\" will become a priority for the country.\n\nNorth Korea \"will intensify close ties and dialogue\" -- The country says it'll improve relations with neighboring countries and the international community to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and beyond.\n\nSix nuclear tests\n\nNorth Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test last September deep underground at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, in North Hamgyong province. The explosion created a magnitude-6.3 tremor, making it the most powerful weapon Pyongyang has ever tested.\n\n\u200b\n\nNorth Korea has worked for years to miniaturize a nuclear warhead so it can be fitted atop a long-range missile and survive the heat-intensive process of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nLast year, Pyongyang tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile it said could reach the entire US mainland, raising the threat that Kim could realistically follow through on his threat to target the US.\n\nHistoric summits planned\n\nThe decision to halt nuclear and missile testing comes just one week before the leaders of South and North Korea are due to meet at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries.\n\nThe planned encounter follows months of warming relations since Kim held out an olive branch during this year's New Year's speech.\n\nThe two countries started talking again for the first time in two years via a special phone line, and those talks led to North Korea's participation in South Korea's Winter Olympics.\n\nKim extended an invitation to South Korean President Moon Jae-In to go to Pyongyang, and the two agreed to meet next Friday, April 27, at the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries. Ahead of the talks, a hotline between the two capitals was reconnected Friday afternoon."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2018/04/17/north-korea-kim-jong-un-diplomacy-mkd-lon-orig.cnn", "published": "2018-04-18T07:13:59", "title": "What's bringing Kim Jong Un to the table", "text": "North Korea's relationship with the world seems to be changing for the better.

denuclearization", "text": "(CNN) When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his South Korea counterpart, Moon Jae-in, meet next Friday, the most important topic on the agenda is the one on which there has been least clarity: denuclearization.\n\nThe term has been bandied about in recent weeks, from Seoul to Washington to Beijing, yet there's little agreement on what the term means -- and confusion could lead to trouble in this week's summit as well as the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim.\n\nSouth Korean officials and Chinese state media have said Kim is willing to discuss denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOn Thursday, President Moon announced North Korea had not raised its long-running demand for the withdrawal of US forces in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons -- an apparent concession that analystsgreeted with skepticism.\n\n\"North Korea has been saying all the right things ... they want this summit to occur and they're doing what it takes to make it happen,\" said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nSo far, North Korean state media has made no mention of the topic, and public statements by Kim have been vague.\n\nKim said in Beijing on March 27, \"It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula, in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il,\"Kimsaid in Beijing on March 27, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.\n\nIt elicited a positive response from US President Donald Trump, who said there was now a \"good chance\" of denuclearization by North Korea.\n\nBut are Trump, Kim and Moon talking about same thing when it comes to North Korea giving up its nuclear capabilities?\n\nDenuclearization: What the US and South Korea mean\n\nOver the past decade, denuclearization in North Korea has only ever meant one thing for the United States and South Korea.\n\n\"It's called CVID -- complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of the North Korean program,\" said Josh Pollack, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\nresolutions condemning North Korea The language has been used consistently by the United Nations Security Council in itsresolutions condemning North Korea as far back as October 2006\n\n\"Irreversible,\" in the practical sense, aims to ensure the current facilities cannot be reactivated after they've been dismantled, Pollack said.\n\nAny denuclearization deal would need to include a series of \"verifiable\" steps for dismantling North Korea's program, carried out under the eyes of independent observers, former Australian Prime Minister and diplomat Kevin Rudd told CNN in March.\n\n\"Unless there is independent monitoring ... any unilateral undertakings by the North Koreans will probably not be worth the paper they're written on,\" he said.\n\nInspections could be carried out by an international body such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) whose inspectors were previously expelled by North Korea in 2002.\n\nFor decades, the US and South Korea have pushed for denuclearization in North Korea.\n\nIn 1991, Pyongyang joined Seoul in signing a \"joint declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" Two years later, North Korea pledged it would dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid.\n\nStill, the US government appears hopeful the latest round of talks will be different. Trump on Wednesday offered a bullish view , insisting he's positioned to accomplish what his predecessors could not.\n\nHowever, he said he'd be willing to stand up and leave the highly anticipated summit should the meeting fall short of his expectations.\n\nOn South Korea's part, Moon denied on Thursday there was any separation between what the North and the South meant by denuclearization. \"I do not think there is any difference in the concept,\" he said.\n\nDenuclearization: What North Korea means\n\nWhen North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promised talks on denuclearization in Beijing in March, according to Xinhua, he didn't speak of Pyongyang ending its program. He spoke of \"denuclearization on the (Korean) Peninsula.\"\n\n\"To Kim, denuclearization applies to the whole peninsula, which includes the South,\" David Maxwell, retired US Army Special Forces colonel and a fellow at the Institute of Korean American Studies, told CNN in March, prior to Moon's statement on Thursday.\n\nExperts said Pyongyang has long been expected to push for American military presence across the border to be part of the discussion, a position Pollack said he wasn't sure had changed despite the South Korean's president's remarks.\n\nAlthough the US hasn't stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea since 1992, Pollack said North Korea considered the US's mere presence on the peninsula a nuclear threat.\n\n\"They really are threatened by superior American and South Korean military power, they need nuclear weapons to try and prevent an invasion in their view,\" Pollack said.\n\n\"They feel the need to equate their nuclear program with the (US and South Korean) military alliance and claims the military alliance is a nuclear threat, when there's no real grounds for that.\"\n\nExperts said North Korea's apparent change of heart on the US military presence in South Korea seemed at best a temporary concession or, at worst, an attempt to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul.\n\n\"The pessimistic interpretation is that Kim is intent on making concession after concession in private to show Moon that he is the reasonable one, with the expectation that Trump will ultimately be unable or unwilling to deliver,\" Pollack said.\n\n'Pie in the sky'\n\nExperts told CNN the confusion over how much each side was willing to give and what their basic goals were for the summits make a positive outcome harder to see.\n\nAdam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea at the University of Leeds in the UK, said the hopes of some officials in Washington that Kim would willingly give up his nuclear weapons program were \"utopian, really pie in the sky.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN in March, Cathcart said given the ongoing \"disdain\" the Trump administration had shown for the Iran deal reached during President Barack Obama's administration, it was hard to see a similar, incremental plan getting support in Washington.\n\nThe deal removed many of the sanctions on the Iran government, in exchange for the Middle East country getting rid of the majority of its weapons program and uranium -- a key ingredient for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe reality, argue analysts, is there simply too much distrust and too little understanding between the two sides to come to an agreement.\n\n\"They will affirm the principle of denuclearization as they did in 2005,\" said Pollack. \"And the implementation will be drawn up and never happen,\" he said."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/politics/keith-davidson-michael-cohen/index.html", "published": "2018-04-21T02:06:31", "title": "Former lawyer for Stormy Daniels cooperating with Cohen probe", "text": "(CNN) Keith Davidson, the lawyer at the center of agreements with two women paid to keep silent about alleged affairs from more than a decade ago with Donald Trump, is cooperating with the probe into the President's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, Davidson's spokesman said Friday.\n\n\"Mr. Davidson has been contacted by the federal authorities regarding the Michael Cohen probe in the Southern District of New York.

And she's returning this weekend for the festival's reprise.\n\nThe first, career-spanning set, complete with a surprise reformation of Destiny's Child to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary, saw her become the first black woman to headline the festival.\n\n\"The word 'iconic' only begins to scratch the surface of how black America felt when an unapologetic black woman, born and raised in the belly of the south, headlined one of the whitest music festivals in America,\" says Kristi Henderson, a senior member at Colour of Change - America's largest online racial justice organisation.\n\nThe pop superstar paid homage to the landmark occasion by infusing her performance with black power symbolism.\n\nIn doing so, Henderson says Beyonce \"echoed the resilience of a people who continue to be criminalised and persecuted for sitting, standing, walking, talking, laughing, thinking, riding in cars, breathing and for being black in America\".\n\nThe 36-year-old singer - a strong civil rights advocate and supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement - collaborated with Olivier Rousteing, creative director of French fashion house Balmain, to produce the politically-charged costume designs.\n\nHere, we take a look at what the symbols mean and represent.\n\nQueen Nefertiti\n\nThe centrepiece outfit was a headdress and full-body costume inspired by Queen Nefertiti.

Analyst Ankit Panda asks what the North Korean leader hopes to gain with his latest move.\n\nNorth Korea's declaration will no doubt lead to effusive headlines touting an end to nuclear and long-range missile testing, but a look at the country's historical record and the context of its nuclear and missiles programme suggests that we might temper our expectations.\n\nFirst, regarding nuclear testing, the statement released on Saturday makes clear that the reason Kim Jong-un is submitting voluntarily to a testing freeze and to the closing of the Punggye-ri nuclear testing site - the scene of all six of North Korea's nuclear tests since 2006 - is because he feels that his country has mastered the design of nuclear weapons.\n\nAlthough difficult to verify, this claim is not obviously an exaggeration or incredulous.\n\nConsider that India and Pakistan, by 1998, had each conducted six nuclear tests and are now counted among the pantheon of nuclear weapons possessors, without conducting further tests.\n\nNorth Korea, with an additional eight years of access to knowledge available in open source material concerning nuclear weapons design, can feel similarly comfortable with its six nuclear tests.\n\n'City-busting yields'\n\nOn a more granular level, North Korea's fifth and sixth nuclear tests - in September 2016 and 2017 respectively - marked important benchmarks. The September 2016 test, according to North Korean state media, involved a standardized and compact nuclear device, one that could be mounted on any of its various short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental-range missiles (ICBMs).\n\nImage copyright KCNA via REUTERS Image caption Kim Jong-un has taken a close personal interest in the North Korean missile programme\n\nThe expected yield - or explosive power - of those weapons might be of the order of two-to-three times the weapon that the United States used against Nagasaki in the final days of the Second World War - but that's quite powerful enough for North Korea's purposes.\n\nMore seriously, North Korea's most recent nuclear test demonstrated that it had the capability to generate seriously powerful nuclear yields.\n\nWhile independent experts and various national intelligence agencies haven't reached a consensus on whether North Korea had truly mastered a thermonuclear bomb design, as it claimed to have done, the seismic data recorded on 3 September 2017 gave the world enough information to conclude that North Korea had a nuclear device capable of \"city-busting\" explosive yields.\n\nThe bottom line is that just as Kim Jong-un's recent trip to Beijing was a show of strength - a signal that he felt comfortable enough in his consolidated domestic power to leave North Korea - so too is the declaration of a nuclear test ban a sign that he feels renewed confidence.\n\nLimited costs to halting missile tests\n\nRegarding his missiles, Kim has said that he will no longer test ICBMs.\n\nOn the one hand, that's surprising.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted just three tests in total of missiles that could deliver nuclear weapons to the contiguous United States. None of these tests have involved a missile flying on a trajectory similar to what might be necessary for a nuclear strike, leaving further flight-testing something of a necessity for North Korea to become sufficiently confident in its ability to strike the US homeland.\n\nBut North Korea may have other plans. For instance, while it has mastered most of what is necessary on a technical level to threaten the United States, its missile forces continue to be limited by a small number of launchers. Currently, North Korea has probably only six launch vehicles for its ICBMs.\n\nEven though Kim Jong-un, during his 2017 New Year's address, declared his nuclear forces \"complete,\" there is good reason to believe that he would want to increase his ICBM launchers and even work on components of North Korea's nuclear command and control systems.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption North Korea may now want to concentrate on developing launch vehicles, not missiles themselves\n\nTactically, then, submitting to a self-imposed ICBM flight-testing ban would have limited costs.\n\nEasy to break ban\n\nUltimately, these test bans are restricted in their extent.\n\nThe nuclear test ban could be made credible by a bona fide gesture at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korea, for instance, could demolish its test tunnels; the statement released on Saturday notes only that the site will be \"dismantled\".\n\nBut as long as North Korea hangs on to its missiles, it can break its self-imposed ban with little warning. In 1999, North Korea submitted to a missile testing moratorium, but that eventually broke down in 2006, a few years after the collapse of the 1994 Agreed Framework.\n\nBeyond the bans, Mr Kim used the latest Central Committee meeting to tout the success of his fundamental national strategic project, which is summarized in what he has called the byungjin line. This concept refers to the simultaneous development of a powerful state nuclear force alongside a more prosperous economy.\n\nOn Saturday, Kim Jng-un clearly indicated that with the cessation of nuclear testing, he will \"concentrate all the efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and markedly improving the standard of people's living.\"\n\nThat should be taken seriously. North Korea will seek relief from international sanctions at the forthcoming summits to realise this objective.\n\nThe summit is the prize\n\nThe concessions from North Korea have come before the two anticipated summits with the United States and South Korea.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim comes just months after the pair exchanged deeply personal insults\n\nOne may wonder why Mr Kim should give up so much in advance instead of hanging on to a nuclear test-ban and an ICBM moratorium as aces up his sleeve to give up when he meets US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe answer is simple: a summit with a US president is enough of a prize in itself. For Mr Kim, it's something that neither his grandfather nor his father could attain.\n\nIn the end, what North Korea loses by demolishing its nuclear test site and submitting to a unilateral moratorium on ICBM launches is entirely tolerable compared to what Mr Kim gains by sitting alongside President Trump.\n\nReading KCNA's announcements on Saturday, there is also absolutely no hint of the \"denuclearization\" intent that South Korean officials have been eager to tout on North Korea's behalf.\n\nOn the contrary, North Korea's announcement sounds like the declamations of a nuclear weapons state - one that has no intention of giving up those weapons which give the country its ultimate guarantee of survival.\n\nEven though President Trump has lauded Mr Kim's move as \"big progress,\" the sooner he recognises Kim's ultimate objectives, the better.\n\nAnkit Panda is an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists and a senior editor at The Diplomat."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43845137", "published": "2018-04-20T20:55:35", "title": "Avicii: The superstar DJ behind some of the decade's biggest hits", "text": "Image copyright AFP\n\nThe death of Swedish DJ Avicii, whose supreme knack for uplifting, melodic pop-house hits made him one of the world's biggest dance producers, has left fans and fellow musicians in deep shock.\n\nHe was just 28.

My only regret is that I didn't sign him on a longer deal.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nReaching new Levels\n\nAfter making his name with a string of singles, Avicii's popularity exploded with the song Levels in 2011.\n\nThe song combines a pulsating, euphoric hook with a sample of Etta James' Something's Got a Hold on Me, and reached platinum status in at least 10 countries.\n\nThat success snowballed with dancefloor anthems like I Could Be The One with Nicky Romero and the country-tinged Wake Me Up, featuring the vocals of Aloe Blacc - both UK number one singles in 2013.\n\nAvicii had a range of influences he could reach for, but his biggest hits had the same elements - insistent, escapist house production; guest vocals to lend accessibility and depth; and, above all, irresistible melodies.\n\nWhen it was suggested that he didn't make \"real music\", he told the Standard: \"You are drawing the melodies, drawing the chord progressions. You are making music. Mozart wrote everything down on a piece of paper. DJs write on computers. I really don't see any difference.\"\n\nA superstar among DJs\n\nThe hits kept coming - in the form of songs like Hey Brother, You Make Me, The Nights and Waiting For Love.\n\nAs Billboard magazine wrote: \"Even when he's being cheesy, it's the kind of cheese you wanna cover your fries in and just give yourself heartburn shoving down your own throat.\"\n\nAvicii headlined festivals and became the first EDM DJ to pull off a worldwide arena tour, earning $19m in 2015, according to Forbes.\n\nBig-name collaborations saw him work with Coldplay, Rita Ora, Sia, Lenny Kravitz, Leona Lewis and Robbie Williams. Last year, he was reported to have been working with disco legend Nile Rodgers on Chic's comeback album.\n\nAnd high-profile gigs included the 2014 World Cup closing ceremony and the wedding of Sweden's Prince Carl Philip.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nGigging for good causes\n\nIn 2012, the DJ embarked on a 27-date US House for Hunger tour, pledging $1m for the hunger relief charity Feeding America.\n\n\"I discovered when I started making money that I didn't really need it,\" he once said. \"When you have such an excess of money you don't need, the most sensible, most human and completely obvious thing is to give to people in need.\"\n\nHe also supported other causes. In 2015, he tackled the issues of human trafficking and gang violence when he directed the videos for his tracks For a Better Day and Pure Grinding. \"All the songs have a story I wanted to tell,\" Avicii said.\n\nHeavy drinking and health setbacks\n\nAvicii's health problems began in January 2012, when he spent 11 days in hospital with acute pancreatitis, reportedly caused by heavy drinking.\n\n\"Drinking became routine for me, but it's impossible to keep up touring and drinking at the same time, because you are going to crash,\" he told the Standard. \"Especially when you are playing 320 shows a year.'\n\nHe went back into hospital in 2013 and was advised to have his gallbladder removed. He declined and continued touring, but was forced to have the surgery in 2014. Doctors discovered his appendix had ruptured, and removed that at the same time.\n\n\"I took a month off, but it wasn't really a month off,\" he told Billboard. \"I was in the studio 12 hours a day, and then went right back to touring. It's hard to say no in this industry. You want to play everything and be everywhere.\"\n\nTouring takes its toll\n\nDespite his health problems, the announcement in 2016 that he was retiring from touring still came as a shock.\n\n\"To me it was something I had to do for my health,\" he told the Hollywood Reporter. \"The scene was not for me. It was not the shows and not the music. It was always the other stuff surrounding it that never came naturally to me.\n\n\"I'm more of an introverted person in general. It was always very hard for me. I took on board too much negative energy, I think.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, he said he had got his \"private life back\" and was \"focusing on myself for the first time in a long time\".\n\n\"This was obviously the hardest decision of my life so far,\" he said. \"But so far it has paid off tremendously in terms of well-being for me. I'm happier than I have been in a very very long time.\"\n\nHis final gig was in Ibiza in August 2016, and he released a comeback EP in August 2017.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

I didn't see it coming,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Barry Trott said he had expected some \"warning signs\" before collapsing\n\nIn contrast, Sophie Everett, from Chester, was able to finish her first marathon, in Chester in 2013, despite feeling a nagging, \"knife-like pain\" in her feet.\n\nBut weeks later the pain had not left and she was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis - a chronic injury to the foot and heel.\n\nSo were these unlucky experiences or are marathons actually risky for our health?\n\n'Massive challenge'\n\nMarathons are a \"massive physical challenge\" for our bodies, says Dr Mark Lake, a sports scientist at Liverpool John Moores University who studies how movement affects the tissues of the body, such as muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments.\n\nEven in regular runners they fatigue the body to \"the verge of being at risk of damage\" and take weeks to recover from, he says.\n\nDoing them requires fitness and conditioning throughout the body.\n\nBut if this is built up too quickly over-use injuries, such as shin splints or stress fractures, can occur.\n\n\"You have to allow the body to adapt to it,\" Dr Lake says.\n\n\"You'd want to get someone to gradually train for it over a period of months, so the body has the chance to adapt in terms of the additional load it has to cope with.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Marathons can lead to over-use injuries in people who are not properly prepared\n\nThe risk of injury is greatest for people who:\n\nare overweight and unfit\n\nhave had a previous injury\n\nhave bodies that are asymmetrical in any way - such as having one leg shorter than the other\n\nThat is because these factors combined cause greater, more uneven impact on our joints.\n\n\"The most at risk person would tick those three boxes: they're overweight, dramatically increase their training to cope [with doing a marathon] and have some issue with how their body is aligned,\" Dr Lake says.\n\nAdaptation process\n\nBut what about for people who take the time to prepare properly - do those miles not invariably take a toll on things such as our joints and other parts of the body?\n\nIt appears not, Dr Lake says. Because while the marathons themselves are a huge challenge for our bodies, if training for them is done properly it is likely to strengthen and condition not only our muscles - but also our joints and even our bones,\n\n\"As part of the adaptation process, you would obviously benefit,\" he says.\n\n\"You'd probably have healthier bones, you'd probably lose weight, your cardiovascular system is going to be healthier. And in terms of joints and things like that, they're going to become conditioned.\"\n\nKeeping hydrated\n\nIn a hard race on a hot and humid day, marathon runners can lose up to four litres (seven pints) of fluid through sweating and exhalation.\n\nThis puts them at risk of dehydration and hyperthermia, where the body's temperature is greatly above normal.\n\n\"Most of the collapses you'll see on Sunday will be associated with over-heating,\" Greg Whyte, professor of sports science at Liverpool John Moores University says.\n\nTo prevent this runners should keep properly hydrated by drinking \"little, often and early\", he says.\n\nSome experts warn against taking on too much liquid, because in extreme cases it can lead to water intoxication, a potentially fatal condition.\n\nProf Whyte said this was \"very uncommon\" and people were far more likely to end up dehydrated.\n\n\"The primary way we combat this [over-heating] is through evaporative sweat loss, which requires fluids,\" he adds.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Runners should not drink at every drinks station during a marathon\n\nStomach cramps and diarrhoea can also strike during marathons because of how long-distance running can disrupt digestion.\n\nThis can happen to people who have carbohydrate drinks or gels for the first time during a marathon, Dr Stephen Mears, a lecturer in sports and exercise nutrition at Loughborough University says.\n\nHe says those who plan to take these during a marathon should first practise taking them under race conditions to see how their bodies react.\n\nDeaths\n\nIn some cases people have died during marathons, but deaths of marathon runners are extremely rare.\n\nUS research previously looked at nearly 11 million runners who participated in marathons or half-marathons between 2000 and 2010.\n\nOver the decade, 59 of the runners had a cardiac arrest - where the heart stops working - and 42 of these people died.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption People should get a check-up with a doctor before running a marathon\n\nDr David Oxborough, who has studied how marathons affect the heart, says when deaths during marathons do happen they tend to occur in people who had undiagnosed heart problems, either in older people or in those with inherited conditions.\n\n\"You're exercising, you are putting your heart under strain, and therefore if it is compromised in some degree it could potentially cause you to have a cardiac event,\" he says.\n\nWhile these deaths are rare, Dr Oxborough says they underscore why it is important for people to get a health check-up from a doctor before doing a marathon.\n\nSo are marathons bad for us?\n\nWhile marathons are a big challenge for our bodies, ultimately any of the health risks are more than outweighed by the benefits, experts say.\n\n\"There's no doubt if you undergo all of that hard work to gradually condition your body you're going to benefit, without a shadow of a doubt,\" Dr Lake says.\n\nBut experts say the key, particularly for inexperienced runners, is to not do too much too soon, follow a good training plan, and \"listen to your body\".\n\n\"If you haven't done any running for a while you need to go out and see how far you can go for a long walk first,\" Dr Lake adds.\n\n'It's a personal challenge'\n\nSophie Everett has not run since her first and last marathon because of the ongoing pain in her feet, but Barry Trott has since gone on to complete several marathons.\n\nHe said it was the \"personal challenge\" of marathon running that motivated him to do more.\n\n\"I can run another distance and skive off the training and get around and it wouldn't be too bad, but if you don't do it properly for a marathon it's horrific.\n\n\"It's big, it's tough, it's a bit scary and you've got to get it right.\"\n\nTips for a first marathon\n\nSeek medical advice before doing a first marathon - particularly those with existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or who have had previous injuries\n\nTake a minimum of four months and ideally six to prepare for the marathon and get your body used to the extra stress being placed on it\n\nTrain three to five times per week and build your weekly mileage over time, with runs of varying intensity in terms of distance and speed\n\nMake sure to have enough rest and recovery - proper rest helps prevent injuries and mental burnout\n\nDevelop a strategy for what and how much you'll drink and eat during the marathon\n\nEat plenty of carbohydrates in the week of the marathon - your body will use this for fuel\n\nSource: London Marathon\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-43758698", "published": "2018-04-21T00:00:57", "title": "HQ Trivia: The free app giving away thousands of pounds", "text": "Image copyright HQ Trivia\n\nHow do you win thousands of pounds straight from your phone for free?

Stansted?", "text": "Image copyright Stansted Image caption The future arrives: CGI of the planned new arrivals terminal\n\nStansted Airport has always been a bit of underdog. Nestled in the Essex countryside, 40 miles from central London, its fortunes have been tied to the low-cost airline revolution of the 90s and especially its biggest customer - Ryanair.\n\nIt is synonymous with bleary-eyed early starts, cheap flights and pre-6am pints.\n\nIts more global and glamorous sisters, Heathrow and Gatwick, have long tussled over who should take the ultimate next step and gain the right to build another runway.\n\nStansted, on the other hand, has been busy with its own, more immediate practical business of mopping up cheap flights across Europe to destinations such as Timisoara, in western Romania.\n\nBut is Stansted now becoming its own Cinderella success story?\n\nRunaway growth\n\nThe airport's bosses claim Stansted is set to be London's fastest-growing airport with more than 10.8 million airline seats available this summer, 1.2 million more than in summer 2017.\n\nImage copyright Stansted Image caption Stansted boss, Ken O'Toole\n\nAccording to them, Stansted's growth will surpass all other London airports, with a 12.1% year-on-year increase in demand for runway slots, compared with 1.4% at Heathrow, and 2.1% at Gatwick.\n\nStansted will welcome five new airlines this year - Primera Air, Emirates, WOW air, Air Corsica and Wideroe - serving destinations ranging from New York, Washington DC, Boston and Toronto to Dubai, Corsica, Reykjavik and Kristiansand (Norway).\n\nThe airport will also be transformed with a new \u00a3130m arrivals terminal.\n\nThe 34,000 sq m (365,972 sq ft), three-level building will be built next to the current terminal and is expected to be completed by 2021.\n\nImage copyright Stansted Image caption How the future will look: Stansted's new arrival terminal\n\n\"Stansted now sits in a geographic sweet spot serving both London, which is rapidly expanding north and eastwards towards the airport, and the vibrant East Anglian region,\" says Ken O'Toole, chief executive of Stansted Airport.\n\n\"This, coupled with constraints on runway capacity elsewhere in the South East, means we are expecting our passenger numbers to reach 35 million per annum in the early 2020s.\"\n\nUpgraded retail\n\nSo what is behind Stansted's surge?\n\nThe airport's ownership changed hands in 2013 when BAA was forced to sell Stansted as a result of a ruling by the Competition Commission.\n\nSince then, its new owner Manchester Airports Group (MAG) has spent \u00a3150m upgrading the Norman Foster-designed terminal with a focus on improving its retail space.\n\nThe airport now earns \u00a36.20 per passenger from non-aviation revenue - primarily, retail and car parking - more than the \u00a35.40 it does from the flights themselves.\n\nImage copyright Primera Image caption \"Passenger flow... is tremendous,\" says Anastasija Visnakova, Primera's chief commercial officer\n\nBut it isn't just the better shops that are attracting new airlines such as low-cost Latvia-based airline, Primera, which starts a new long haul service to New York on Thursday.\n\n\"Stansted allows us to grow,\" says Anastasija Visnakova, Primera's chief commercial officer.\n\n\"London to New York is one of the biggest routes in the world,\" she says. The demand from people wanting to travel is just endless, and to profit, \"you just have to be there at the right time, in the right moment, with the right tools\".\n\nMore routes?\n\nBut Stansted has flirted and failed with long-haul flights before.\n\nAnother low cost carrier, Air Asia X, began a service from Essex to Kuala Lumpur in 2009 but it closed two years later. Two transatlantic business-class only airlines, Eos and MaxJet, have also failed from Stansted.\n\n\"Perhaps it wasn't the right time for those airlines. But I wouldn't bet against new routes coming back to Stansted,\" says Ms Visnakova - who hints her airline is looking at launching new flights to different continents from Stansted.\n\n\"Passenger flow has increased around the world. It is tremendous. There are people travelling today who we'd never think would be travelling even a year ago. Times are changing, the equipment is changing, the technology is changing.\n\n\"Aviation is becoming more affordable and the selection of the right routes with the right intelligence behind them will succeed.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Stansted currently handles 26.1 million passengers a year\n\nAnalysis, John Strickland, aviation expert\n\nI worked at Stansted between 1990-2003, for KLM's UK subsidiary, Air UK, which launched a network of domestic and European services. Later we established Buzz, a low-cost airline which added more European destinations.\n\nThe 90s saw some false starts with several major European airlines testing out services to their continental hubs but none enduring. There was even a short-lived Chicago service operated by American Airlines.\n\nThe airport wasn't as well known as it is today and it took the massive growth by low-cost carriers to put it firmly on the map. As access has improved from further afield and other airports have become more congested, Stansted can now support more varied services.\n\nThe arrival of Emirates, in particular, is a real vote of confidence. The airline's powerful Dubai hub will provide worldwide access to the airport's growing catchment. Emirates understands the advantages which Stansted offers.\n\nThe growing tech and pharma industry around Cambridge and easy access to North London, Essex, East Anglia and the Midlands will all support selective growth at the airport. While Stansted won't become another Heathrow, it has a growing role to play.\n\nStansted's biggest opportunity lies in its spare capacity.\n\n\"Heathrow is full, Gatwick is pretty much full, if anyone wants to grow in London we've got the capacity to make that happen,\" says Ken O'Toole.\n\nGatwick is the world's second-busiest single runway airport in the world after Mumbai and handles 45.7 million passengers per year.\n\nStansted, in contrast, currently handles 26.1 million, but a \"planning cap\" limits its passenger numbers to 35 million per year. It has recently applied to extend this to 43 million.\n\n\"When MAG acquired Stansted from BAA in 2013, it would be fair to say that the airport had lots of untapped potential. Almost exactly five years later, and having brought a new ambition to the airport, we have a real momentum and we are predicting continued strong growth in passenger numbers.\""}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43834898", "published": "2018-04-20T18:23:49", "title": "National Trust: Is it relevant if you live in a town or city?", "text": "Image caption Hackney - an unexpected home for a National Trust property?\n\nWith its Tudor beams, scone-filled tea-rooms and a second-hand bookshop, Sutton House is just what you would expect from a National Trust property.\n\nBut the 16th-century house isn't in a quaint countryside village. It's on a busy main road in Hackney - one of the most deprived boroughs in London.\n\nIt's also in a prime position to target people from urban areas. That's something the National Trust's new boss Hilary McGrady says the charity needs to focus on as it adopts a \"radical\" new direction.\n\nSo how does the 123-year-old organisation change its traditional image?\n\nWhat's the perception?\n\n\"People think National Trust is a crumbling pile in the country. People think that London isn't a National Trust place\" - so says Sean Curran, one of the managers at Sutton House.\n\nThe charity, which had a record 24.5m visitors at its paid-for-entry properties last year, owns more than 500 historic houses, castles, ancient monuments, gardens, parks and nature reserves - most of them in rural parts of the UK.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dyffryn House in the Vale of Glamorgan is one of 300 historic houses looked after by the National Trust\n\nMrs McGrady says it needs to be more relevant to town and city dwellers, saying \"the days of walking into one of our beautiful houses and saying a family lived here - that's not going to do it\".\n\n\"We need to think about what's relevant - why would someone in the middle of Birmingham say that's interesting?\"\n\nJust 17% of the UK population lives in rural areas, according to government statistics. And less than half of these people are under the age of 45. By contrast, 60% of people living in urban areas are aged 44 or younger.\n\nHackney's oldest house\n\nSutton House began life in 1535 as a home to merchants and sea captains, although it briefly housed squatters and was used as a music venue in the 1980s.\n\nThe Grade II listed manor house on Homerton High Street is the oldest property in Hackney.\n\nImage caption Sutton House tries to get the local community involved in its projects\n\nSean Curran, 33, Sutton House's community learning manager, says he is \"well aware\" that many local people can't afford to pay to get in - it's \u00a37 for adults - but that the local community gets involved in other ways.\n\n\"It's not free and isn't going to be in the budget for a lot of working families,\" he said. \"We want the local people to come here and we accept that there are barriers.\"\n\n\"We're in a very unique place. It gives us the opportunity to be creative.\n\n\"It's not the typical twin set and pearls here - although we get that too. But that's not our community.\"\n\nSome of their free activities, he says, include LGBT events, art workshops, history projects for refugees and a group called the Recycle Teenagers - mostly made up of women from the Caribbean community aged over 55.\n\nImage caption Sean Curran with Sutton House's \"Recycle Teenagers\"\n\nHe said: \"Even though there's no LGBT connection to the history of the house, we've held drinks nights and exhibitions - we wanted to challenge people to think about what a National Trust house could be.\"\n\nIt also has what it regards as another unique selling point: \"We're the first National Trust house to have a gender-neutral toilet\".\n\nGus Carrera, 28, who has lived and worked in Hackney for years, said he hadn't heard of Sutton House before.\n\n\"I don't think the National Trust is for people living in cities - it makes me think of big, grand places in the countryside,\" he said.\n\nBut it has made its mark on his colleague, Lucy Snowdale, 38, who said she found out about it when it was recommended to her by an older neighbour.\n\n\"I know Sutton House well, I've been there several times with my children,\" she said. \"It's not too busy, like some other places, and has lots of events in the holidays.\"\n\nImage caption Gus (second from the left) and his colleague Lucy have different attitudes to the National Trust\n\nAnd a short walk away...\n\nA mile down the road is a popular non-National Trust attraction - Hackney City Farm, which was set up in the 1980s to give people experience of animals.\n\nIt has free entry, and was bustling with people enjoying the unseasonably hot April weather.\n\nChris Pounds, who has managed the farm for nearly 20 years, explains how it gets the community involved.\n\n\"We've made ourselves into a hub for other activities, so it's not all about going to a farm - there's a local tenants' group who meet here, and a group of cyclists who help people fix bikes.\n\n\"It's kind of like dropping a pebble and getting a ripple effect.\n\n\"One person comes to the farm, then they say it to a friend - all these people started coming to us and using us as a hub.\n\nImage caption Chris Pounds has managed Hackney City Farm for nearly 20 years\n\nHe says it will be \"really hard\" for the National Trust to overcome an image of being about grand houses.\n\n\"The cost probably does put people off the National Trust,\" he added. \"But money is important for the National Trust, and for us, and you have to work with your budget.\"\n\nAnnual membership costs \u00a369 for adults, \u00a334.50 for young adults aged 18-25, and \u00a310 for children - but daily prices can be expensive.

And what might happen next? BBC Sport's David Ornstein explains...\n\nBig-name boss? Or promising coach?\n\nChief executive Ivan Gazidis says Arsenal had not begun sounding out replacements before Friday and I suspect Wenger will not have a say.\n\nLeading the process will be Gazidis, alongside head of football relations Raul Sanllehi and head of recruitment Sven Mislintat.\n\nArsenal have been linked to the former Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who has admirers at the club. But any move might have been complicated by the fact he fell out with Mislintat when they were together in Germany.\n\nThat will likely be irrelevant, though, as it is my understanding he is going to take charge of Paris St-Germain.\n\nTuchel was an early favourite with bookmakers to take over from Wenger\n\nBig-name options such as Max Allegri, from Juventus, and former AC Milan, Real Madrid and Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti have been mentioned but a younger coach - one who is more willing to slot into the club's revamped structure - might be more appealing.\n\nThat is why former captain Mikel Arteta - an assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and said to be admired by Gazidis - and another former skipper Patrick Vieira - who is at New York City - have been linked, although both lack elite-level management experience. Likewise, club record goalscorer Thierry Henry, who is currently Belgium assistant coach.\n\nThe backgrounds of Sanllehi and Mislintat have seen suggestions that Luis Enrique - who Sanllehi worked with at Barcelona - and Hoffenheim boss Julian Nagelsmann - who Mislintat knows from Germany - could also be candidates.\n\nBut Arsenal will not seek simply to make a quick appointment.\n\nWhat has been happening behind the scenes?\n\nArsenal has become a deeply political club at board level. They were split on whether Wenger should have signed a new two-year contract last summer, and that situation had not changed.\n\nThe difference compared to a year ago is that Arsenal have a new structure off the pitch - Sanllehi arrived from Barcelona; Mislintat from Dortmund; head of negotiations Huss Fahmy from Team Sky; and head of high performance Darren Burgess from Australian Rules football.\n\nAll four have inherited significant power and influence, and worked with American majority shareholder Stan Kroenke to put a structure in place for life beyond Wenger.\n\nThe only new head of department that had not been appointed was a head coach. The only question was whether that would be Wenger or not.\n\nUntil extremely recently, even some of the most powerful people at the club did not know this was coming. Indeed, there remained a feeling he may see out his contract.\n\nHowever, I have heard suggestions that a five-strong shortlist was drawn up to present to Kroenke in the event of Wenger leaving.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Listen: 'Emotional' Wilson on 'great' Wenger\n\n'Wenger closer to leaving last year than we knew'\n\nWenger's possible departure had been a talking point for months, even years. Every time there was a bad period of form, the rumours started and this recent poor run did not feel any different.\n\nEven when it became known a meeting of staff and players had been called for 09:45 BST on Friday - unusual on a recovery day for players - it was still thought he would not leave.\n\nThe Frenchman has never broken a contract and it is my understanding the club were prepared to see how the season concluded and, provided there was not a catastrophe, leave him in charge until the end of his deal next summer.\n\nI was told very recently that Wenger was as stubborn, determined and energetic as ever and if he was to leave he would need to be dragged out kicking and screaming.\n\nHowever, it is my understanding Wenger was closer to walking away towards the end of last season than we knew at the time. Those closest to him were advising him to leave on a high after the FA Cup win against Chelsea in May.\n\nBut at that time, Arsenal did not have a plan in place to replace him. They were not set up to start a recruitment process. Wenger knew as much and felt - rightly or wrongly - that he would be leaving them in the lurch. He felt it was an obligation to carry on and he thought he could have one last crack at leading this team to success.\n\nBut things have deteriorated, both on the pitch and in the stands. Ask people what has changed and the response is \"that is the problem - nothing\".\n\nWenger has always been the great survivor at Arsenal, he has taken all the bullets and carried on, shielding the board, players and club. But it is only human that he started to feel the criticism piercing him.\n\n'It was a genuinely mutual decision'\n\nIt's not clear who made the first move, but this has been an ongoing discussion for some time. It had become inevitable.\n\nThere was a feeling on Wenger's side that it would be best to do it now, in conjunction with the club hierarchy, to enable him to have a fitting send-off.\n\nIf they were to suffer a heavy defeat in the Europa League, there was a chance he would have to leave in unceremonious fashion. Nobody wanted that. And if they were to win it, Arsenal could end up in the same situation in a year's time.\n\nThe overwhelming feeling is that this is the right decision and my understanding is that it was genuinely mutual.\n\nBy sorting it out earlier, this gives Arsenal the ability to start a recruitment process without doing it behind Wenger's back, or starting too late.\n\nHow will the fans react?\n\nSome fans had called for Wenger to leave before his contract expired\n\nThe decision has been greeted well, tinged with sadness and nostalgia as expected, but also hope and optimism that Arsenal can reunite a fractured fanbase and rally round a new manager.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a very nasty environment. Fans have been divided, there have been fights among Arsenal supporters in stadiums, protests inside and outside grounds, banners saying 'it's time to go' and the slogan 'In Arsene we trust' being replaced by 'In Arsene we rust'.\n\nThe large swathes of empty seats at Emirates Stadium were a sign that the anger had turned into apathy.\n\nArsenal, who used to break records for all the right reasons, were breaking records for the wrong ones - they are the only side in the top four divisions to have lost every away league match this year.\n\nWest Ham on Sunday is the penultimate home Premier League game of Wenger's reign.\n\nDespite growing opposition in recent times, there will be huge support, respect and gratitude from a large crowd. 'There's only one Arsene Wenger' may well be sung for the first time in many, many months.\n\nThe decision has galvanised the fans to get behind the club as they push for victory in the Europa League.\n\nWhat might Wenger do next?\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'Arsene Who?' - Wenger remembers joining Arsenal\n\nWenger has had offers but, short of an opportunity he feels is too good to turn down, it is likely he will take a break for the first time in more than 30 years.

We are going to take what Arsene has given us and continue the values he has instilled.\n\n\"It's going to be a condensed summer with the World Cup in the middle of it.

I don't think there will be other managers who will have that authority at the top of the game at the biggest clubs.\n\n\"It's still the most important employee any club has but it would be unrealistic to think anyone comes in with the breadth and scope Arsene has.\n\n\"He changed the game, set a totally new standard, a new ambition, not just to win but to win while achieving perfection - to make art out of football. He was always brave enough to be true to that ambition.\n\n\"The decision had to happen at some point. I don't think the club has ever been better prepared for it. Now it's time to look forward. He leaves us in a very strong position to look forward.\"\n\nOn Wenger announcing his departure now\n\nThe chief executive said the timing of the decision gives both parties time to plan for the future.\n\n\"I have often said replacing Arsene is the biggest challenge we face. In the coming months, the world will see the unity and power of this football club, and the people within it.\n\n\"People are talking wonderfully about what Arsene has done for Arsenal and the wider world of football.

We've been given someone to help translate and assist us with anything we need, and so far everything's been pretty straightforward.\n\nWe flew via Hong Kong - it's never easy going from west to east with an eight-hour time difference - and I slept like a baby the first night. I slept for 12 hours straight - the one bonus of not having my kids here! Mind you, that hasn't happened again since.\n\nI'm feeling good as we've got a strong team. The format of this competition and the week in general is completely different to what the players experience at a regular WTA event.\n\nBut I take confidence from the fact that when we had Fed Cup in February in Estonia, the players were able to produce really good tennis.\n\nThey are representing their country, they are surrounded by different people and there's a lot of positive energy. Hopefully, that can help raise their level and it certainly gives them something different to play for.\n\nWe don't get as many opportunities in Fed Cup to come together like the Davis Cup team, but when we have come together we've become stronger and stronger as a team with each tie.\n\nWhen I hear Jo Konta talking about our last tie in Estonia being her best experience in the Fed Cup, that excites me - I feel like we are on the right track.\n\nThe more time everyone spends together and the more familiar you become - not just with team-mates but with the support staff as well - the stronger the relationships and trust.\n\nWe have also got to know each other well on court and what helps each player to train and then compete at their best.\n\nOn the practice court, for example, Heather Watson loves to play touch and silly games, which help lift her spirit and energy. This means the coaches often have to do the extra yards with, most of the time, Heather trying to beat them. This can be infectious and helps set the mood for a good session.\n\nJohanna Konta beat Hungary's Fanny Stollar 6-3 6-1 to help GB reach the Fed Cup World Group II play-off\n\nA taste of Kobe and travel karaoke\n\nOn Wednesday night we were able to get out of the hotel, which feels like you could be anywhere. We went to a teppanyaki restaurant, where the chef cooks in front of you, which was unique and allowed us to feel, albeit briefly, immersed in Japanese culture. Pretty much everybody went for Kobe steak, but when in Kobe...\n\nOne member of the team thought the beef was \"too tender\". Harsh feedback. After dinner the players got to walk around Kobe with its vibrant downtown.\n\nIt is on a smaller scale than some Japanese cities, and the girls could check out the local area and sample the atmosphere, which is something they don't get to do too often.\n\nDoing little things like this again allows us to make this week feel different to every other week when the girls are out on the road competing for themselves.\n\nMost evenings after dinner we try to do something as a team. We travel with our own karaoke microphone and there's an app we download as the girls like a good sing song.\n\nAny genre of song goes and everyone is encouraged to perform to the team. Indeed, as I write this the doctor is singing \"boom, shake, shake, shake the room\", I kid you not. I will probably be next.\n\nHeather's probably got the best voice and she leads the way with the dance moves. They all seem to lose their inhibitions and that's a reflection of how comfortable everyone is around each other. It's light-hearted and a good team-building exercise.\n\nHeads Up is another game we enjoy and it gets quite competitive - that's another app, which is basically like charades. The players and myself usually team up against the rest of the support staff. Obviously the support staff never win.\n\nHeather and Jo are both very good - probably the leading actors - and Anna Smith is a movie and song buff so she's very good at naming things.\n\nGabi Taylor is learning from the senior members of the team! This is her first Fed Cup experience so it's a real eye-opener for her and a chance to learn from the others. The girls have done a great job taking her under their wing and showing her the ropes.\n\nThe venue is very striking. It looks like a Teletubbies house - with grass on the roof. But there's plenty of metal up above as well, so it looks like a very secure structure and in the event of an earthquake, this is where they shelter.\n\nAs for the court, there was a fair bit of dust on it when we arrived but they have given it a good clean and it looks a lot better now. It hasn't really affected the speed of the court - it's still pretty fast and the ball checks in places.\n\nWe have prepared the best we can and, come Saturday and Sunday, it's down to the players.

The process takes six months.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Breakthroughs take time to sell\n\nProf Li believes the tech could speed up the flow of vital new medicines because potential side-effects could be spotted before reaching the expensive human trial stage.\n\n\"Drug development is a notoriously lengthy, expensive and inefficient process, typically costing $2-$3bn and taking more than 10 years to develop a single drug, with unacceptably high failure rates of 90% or worse,\" he says.\n\n\"The significant business risk has resulted in depletion of the pipeline of new drugs under experimental development.\"\n\nStem cell-derived, bio-artificial cloned organs built from the patient's own blood could eventually be the future of transplant medicine, says Prof Li.\n\n\"Stem cell-derived tissues and organs are not just science fiction any more.\"\n\nImage copyright Novoheart Image caption Could lab-grown organs help speed up drug development?\n\nAs well as creating \"hearts in a jar\", biotech companies are also \"printing\" living tissue using specialised 3D printers. This tissue can be used to produce skin for grafts, or cartilage for joints, for example.\n\nMethods of bioprinting differ but the underlying principle involves using genetic material or \"bio inks\" the way a normal printer uses ordinary ink, along with a \"scaffolding\" material to join the genetic material together to form specific shapes.\n\nOne bioprinting specialist, Aspect Biosystems, recently formed a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to develop 3D-printed knee meniscus tissue - the thin, fibrous cartilage between some of your joints.\n\n\"In the next 10 to 15 years, I believe we will see the first truly cell-containing bioprinted 3D tissues that are approved for use as implantable tissue therapeutics,\" says Tamer Mohamed, chief executive at Aspect Biosystems.\n\nImage copyright BEMOVED Media Image caption Tamer Mohamed (right) thinks bioprinted tissue will be used for transplants in the future\n\nAs well as cartilage and organs, the synthetic additions to our bodies could one day include \"nanobots\" - tiny programmable bio-machines patrolling our blood streams looking for cancer cells and bacteria to kill, just as our white blood cells do.\n\nArizona State University (ASU) scientists, in collaboration with researchers from the National Centre for Nanoscience and Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently programmed nanobots to shrink tumours by cutting off their blood supply.\n\nUnlike machine robots made of mechanical parts, these nanobots were designed using \"DNA origami\", a technique involving DNA being folded into shapes. Each one was made from a flat, rectangular DNA origami sheet, 90 nanometres by 60 nanometres - a nanometre is a billionth of a metre - and a blood-clotting enzyme, called thrombin, was attached to their surface.\n\nIn the first such test on mammals of its kind, the team injected cancer cells into a mouse to create a tumour, then injected the nanobots.\n\nImage copyright ASU Biodesign Institute Image caption The polymer sheets are rolled up and carry their chemical payload to the cancer\n\nThey started working within hours, blocking the tumour's blood supply and shrinking it after a two-week course of treatment.\n\nHao Yan, director of the ASU Biodesign Institute's Centre for Molecular Design and Biomimetics, says the next step will be to perform a human trial, which should be in the next three-to-five years.\n\n\"This result represents only the beginning stages of nano-medicine,\" he says, \"and we are particularly excited because this technology is a strategy that can be used for many types of cancer, since all solid tumour-feeding blood vessels are essentially the same.\"\n\nSynthetics are also being marshalled in the fight against antimicrobial resistance - when antibiotics become ineffective against new strains of \"superbug\".\n\nThese superbugs kill around 700,000 people a year worldwide, says the UK Review on Antimicrobial Resistance. By 2050, 10 million people could die each year if existing antibiotics continue to lose their effectiveness, the report suggests.\n\nStep forward \"ninja polymers\" - synthetic bacteria killers.\n\nImage copyright IBM Research Image caption The synthetic \"ninja\" polymers attack superbugs and stop them multiplying\n\nScientists at IBM Research Almaden in California, working with Singapore's Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology of the Agency for Science, have developed a synthetic molecule polymer designed to kill five deadly types of multidrug-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe polymer works by binding itself to the infectious material, making its way inside the outer membrane, then turning the liquid inside the bacteria into solid material.\n\nCrucially, this happens so fast that the bacteria don't have time to reproduce and pass on any resistance.\n\nThe team tested the polymers on mice infected with five hard-to-treat multi-drug resistant bacteria - the results showed that the bacteria were destroyed.\n\nOne of the men leading the research, Dr James Hedrick, says the team is also developing the tech for use in cancer therapy, with hopefully far fewer side effects.\n\n\"In each case, the therapeutics are highly selective to their target without detectable side reactions,\" he says.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"Moreover, each of these macromolecular therapies are designed to decompose into innocuous by-products that are easily expelled from the body.\"\n\nDr Bertalan Mesko, director of The Medical Futurist Institute, says medicine has been lagging behind in the technology stakes for far too long.\n\n\"While many industries stepped into the 21st Century, healthcare hasn't.

As night falls - \"after the landscape colours have paled\" - there are, it says, \"breathtaking views of the heavens, aflame with millions of stars\".\n\nArous Village, on the fringe of spectacular coral reefs and the odd shipwreck, appears to be a diving enthusiast's dream.\n\nThe pamphlets were printed in their thousands and distributed in specialist travel agents across Europe. Reservations were booked through an office in Geneva. And over time hundreds of guests went on holiday there.\n\nIt was a long trek. But once at the desert oasis, they enjoyed first-rate facilities, water sports, deep-sea dives and an abundance of fresh food and wine. The visitors' book was a catalogue of glowing comments.\n\nThe Sudanese International Tourist Corporation was also happy. It had leased the site to a group of people introducing themselves as European entrepreneurs, whose venture brought some of the first foreign tourists to the country.\n\nThe only thing was, unbeknown to the guests or the authorities, the Red Sea diving resort was entirely fake.\n\nIt was a front, set up and run for more than four years in the early 1980s by operatives from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency.\n\nMore Long Reads:\n\n'The story of a weird world I was warned never to tell'\n\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love\n\nI advertised for a man to get me pregnant - then I fell in love\n\nThey used it as a cover for an extraordinary humanitarian mission - to rescue thousands of beleaguered Ethiopian Jews stranded in refugee camps in Sudan and evacuate them to Israel. Sudan was an enemy Arab country, and it had to be done without anyone finding out, either there or at home.\n\n\"It was a state secret, nobody talked about it,\" says Gad Shimron, one of the agents who served at the village. \"Even my family didn't know.\"\n\nImage copyright Gad-Shimron Image caption Gad with a Zodiac dinghy near Arous village\n\nThe Ethiopian Jews belonged to a community called Beta Israel (House of Israel), whose origins are shrouded in mystery.\n\nSome believe they descended from one of the so-called 10 lost tribes of the ancient kingdoms of Israel, or from Israelites who accompanied a son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon back to Ethiopia around 950BC. Others think they fled there after the destruction of the first Jewish Temple in 586BC.\n\nThey adhered to the Torah, practised a Biblical version of Judaism and prayed in synagogues. But, isolated from the rest of Jewry for millennia, they believed they were the last remaining Jews in the world. The Beta Israelis' authenticity was confirmed by Israel's chief rabbis in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1977 one of their members, Ferede Aklum, joined a wave of non-Jewish Ethiopian refugees who crossed the border into Sudan to escape civil war and a deepening food crisis.\n\nImage copyright AAEJ Archives Online Image caption Ferede Aklum (left) and Ethiopian Jewish leader Baruch Tegegne\n\nHe sent letters to relief agencies, pleading for help, and one found its way to the Mossad. For the then Israeli Prime Minister, Menachem Begin - himself a refugee from Nazi-occupied Europe - Israel existed as a safe haven for Jews in peril. The Beta Israelis were no exception and he instructed the intelligence agency to act.\n\nLocated by a Mossad agent, Ferede channelled messages back to his community, saying there was a better chance of getting to Jerusalem from Sudan than Ethiopia, which had severely restricted emigration.\n\nIt offered the tantalising opportunity of fulfilling a 2,700-year-old dream. And in the period that followed, some 14,000 Beta Israelis made a perilous 800km (500-mile) journey by foot along with over a million other Ethiopians seeking refuge across the Sudanese border.\n\nImage copyright AAEJ Archives Online Image caption Ethiopian Jews in Sudan, 1983\n\nAbout 1,500 of the Jewish refugees were killed along the way, perished in the squalid camps around Gedaref and Kassala, or were abducted.\n\nAs there were no known Jews in Sudan, a Muslim-majority country, they were instructed not to disclose their religion so as to blend in and not get caught by the Sudanese secret police.\n\nRescue mission\n\nAlmost straight away, some small-scale rescue activities got under way, with Ethiopian Jews spirited out of Sudan to Europe on forged papers, then on to Israel.\n\nSudan's Red Sea coastline, though, presented the possibility of stepping up operations on an altogether different scale.\n\n\"We approached the [Israeli] navy for help,\" says a high-level agent involved in the mission, who did not want to be named.\n\n\"They said, 'OK,' so a couple of Mossad guys went down to Sudan looking for possible landing beaches. They just stumbled across this deserted village on the coast, in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\"For us it was a godsend. If we could get hold of this place and do it up, we could say we're running a diving village, which would give us a reason for being in Sudan and furthermore for roaming around near the beach.\"\n\nWhat happened next is the subject of a soon-to be released Hollywood film called Red Sea Diving Resort. Filmed in Namibia and South Africa, it tells the story of the operation and the village. Though while it is based on true events, some of the scenes are fictitious.\n\nCompleted in 1972 by Italian entrepreneurs, the resort was a cluster of 15 red-roofed bungalows, a kitchen and a large dining room opening out to the beach, a lagoon and the sea.\n\nHowever, with no electricity, water supply or even a road, the Italians found the project impossible and the resort never opened.\n\n\"It's a very difficult place to run, if you don't have the Mossad behind you,\" says the unidentified agent.\n\nUsing false passports, a group of agents posing as employees of a Swiss operating company went to Sudan, convinced the authorities of their business proposition, and rented the village for three years for $320,000 (\u00a3225,000).\n\nFake resort\n\nThey spent the first year renovating it and struck a deal with local suppliers for fresh water and fuel.\n\nThe resort was also kitted out with Israeli-made equipment, including air-conditioning units, outboard motors, and top-of-the-range water sports gear, all smuggled into the country.\n\n\"We introduced windsurfing to Sudan,\" says Gad, smiling. \"The first board was brought in - I knew how to windsurf, so I taught the guests. Other Mossad agents posed as professional diving instructors.\"\n\nThey also recruited about 15 local staff, including chambermaids, waiters, a driver and a chef \"poached\" from a hotel. \"We paid him double,\" says the unnamed operative. None of the staff knew the resort's real purpose, or that their Caucasian managers were Mossad spies.\n\nFemale agents were put in charge of the day-to day running of the place, which it was thought would lower any suspicions.\n\nThe diving storeroom was out-of-bounds. In it were concealed radios the agents used to keep in regular contact with headquarters back in Tel Aviv.\n\nWhile seeing to their guests by day, every so often at night a squad would leave under cover of darkness and head to a rendezvous point 10km (six miles) south of Gedaref.\n\n\"We'd tell the staff we're going to Khartoum for a few days, or to meet some Swedish nurses from the hospital in Kassala,\" says Gad.\n\nThey would pick up groups of Ethiopian Jews, smuggled out of the camps by so-called Committee Men - a handful of Beta Israelis recruited for the job.\n\n\"The Ethiopian Jews were given no notice, as we could not risk word getting out,\" says Gad. \"They did not even know we were Israelis. We told them we were mercenaries.\"\n\nImage copyright Gad Shimron Image caption Gad with another Israeli in a lorry in Sudan\n\nFrom there, a convoy of lorries carrying dozens of bewildered refugees drove a two-day - 800km - journey, evading detection at numerous checkpoints along the way by a combination of guile, bribery and occasionally ramming their way through.\n\nAt breaks, they would try to pacify the frightened passengers.\n\n\"When we let them sit in the driver's cabin and touch the wheel, they were in seventh heaven,\" Gad says, in his book Mossad Exodus. \"It was amazing to see how happy they were at sharing a piece of chewing gum among 20 children. They looked at us as though we were creatures from outer space.\"\n\nWhen they got to the beach, north of the holiday village, Israeli navy special forces would come ashore on Zodiac dinghies, collect the refugees and transport them a further hour and a half to a waiting naval vessel, the INS Bat Galim.\n\nThe ship then took them to Israel.\n\nImage caption Ethiopian Jews being transported by boat from the beach to a navy ship\n\n\"It was constantly dangerous,\" says the unnamed operative. \"We all knew that if any one of us got exposed, we'd end up hanged on gallows in the centre of Khartoum.\"\n\nThey came close to it in March 1982, when on the third such operation the group was spotted in mid-transfer on the beach by Sudanese soldiers. Possibly suspecting smugglers, the soldiers fired warning shots - but the Zodiacs, with the Ethiopians on board, managed to get away.\n\nImage caption Ethiopian Jews eating on board an Israeli navy ship\n\nAfter that, it was decided naval evacuations were too exposed, and a new plan was devised. The agents were tasked with finding a suitable landing spot in the desert for C130 Hercules planes. The refugees were going to be secretly airlifted out of the country.\n\nRead more about Ethiopian Jews:\n\nMystery origins of the Ethiopian Jews\n\n'Last airlift' of Ethiopian Jews to Israel\n\nIn the meantime, the Israelis continued to run the diving resort and entertain the guests. By now, Arous Village had earned quite a reputation and word spread.\n\n\"By comparison to the rest of Sudan, we offered Hilton-like standards,\" says Gad, \"and it was such a beautiful place, it really looked like something out of the Arabian Nights. It was unbelievable.\"\n\nThe resort counted among its varied clientele an Egyptian army unit, a group of British SAS soldiers, foreign diplomats from Khartoum and Sudanese officials - all unaware of their hosts' true identity.\n\nOne German military attache told Gad he had had a good time in many places \"in my life but never quite like this\".\n\nArous Village became so successful that it turned enough of a profit to become financially self-sustaining, much to the relief of the accountants back at Mossad HQ. Some of the money earned from guests was used to buy or rent the lorries that took the refugees.\n\nAirlifted to safety\n\nMeanwhile, the airlifts got under way. Gad and his team got message back that there was an abandoned World War Two British airfield not far from the coast, and in May 1982 the first Hercules, carrying an Israeli platoon, landed there in the dead of night.\n\nYears later, one of the 130 Ethiopians rescued on that flight told Gad: \"You have no idea what it meant for me to go into an aeroplane in the middle of the Sudanese desert on a dark night.\n\n\"I'd never seen an aeroplane in my life before. I felt like Jonah the prophet going into the belly of the whale, and then all of a sudden three hours later I was in Zion [Israel].\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption An Israeli C130 Hercules aircraft\n\nAfter two airlifts however, the Mossad discovered Sudanese authorities had got wind of suspicious activity - the unnamed agent is convinced \"a Bedouin went and ratted on us\". The team was then instructed to find more inconspicuous landing sites.\n\nThey identified suitable locations much nearer Gedaref, which had the advantage of reducing the time on the road with the refugees to a couple of hours. The downside was \"they weren't airstrips, they were just a piece of desert\", according to the unnamed agent.\n\n\"The strips were hardly lit,\" he says. \"We had just 10 tiny infrared lights and the C130 pilots had to find us without navigational aids and after a long, tedious flight, in pitch black.\n\n\"By comparison, Entebbe was a piece of cake as far as flying's concerned,\" he says, referring to the daring hostage rescue in Uganda in 1976, which saw an Israeli Hercules land at the airport in a surprise raid and fly out again with more than 100 people freed by commandos.\n\nDespite the complexities and potentially catastrophic consequences of failure, 17 clandestine flights were carried out, co-ordinated by the agents of the Red Sea diving resort, some 600km away.\n\nTowards the end of 1984, famine was declared in Sudan, and it was decided to escalate the evacuations.\n\nWith intervention from the US, and a large payment, Gen Jaafar Nimeiri agreed to let Jewish refugees be flown directly out from Khartoum to Europe. He did so on condition of total secrecy, so as to avoid repercussions from the rest of the Arab world.\n\nIn a series of 28 covert airlifts, on Boeing 707s lent by a Jewish Belgian airline owner, 6,380 Ethiopian Jews were flown to Brussels and then straight on to Israel. The rescue was codenamed Operation Moses.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ethiopian Jews on board a stripped-out Israeli Air Force Boeing 707 in an airlift from Addis Ababa in 1991\n\nThere was a media blackout in Israel, but eventually \"the thing was leaked to the press by some idiot from the Jewish Agency [an Israeli nonprofit organisation]\", says the unnamed agent.\n\nThe story gets out\n\nNewspapers around the world ran the story on 5 January 1985 and Sudan immediately stopped the flights. It publicly denied any involvement, dismissing allegations it had colluded with Israel as a \"Zionist-Ethiopian plot\".\n\nThe Mossad continued running the holiday village, keeping it available as an undercover option. Despite a pause in rescue operations, the agents still had to cater for the influx of guests, and Gad had even been recalled from leave in Israel to organise the entertainment at Christmas and New Year.\n\nOutside, the atmosphere was changing. \"From January 1985, I could smell it in the air that a coup d'etat was coming,\" says Gad.\n\nIt did not take long. On 6 April 1985, Gen Nimeiri was overthrown by army officers. It was a turn of events that imperilled the operatives at the village.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Gen Nimeiri\n\nThe new military junta turned its sights on flushing out Mossad spies, real or imaginary, to burnish its credentials in the Arab world.\n\nThe head of the Mossad gave the order to evacuate the resort. They did so the very next day, by stealth.\n\n\"Six of us left the diving village in two vehicles before dawn,\" says one of the agents, who wishes to remain anonymous. \"A C130 landed to the north, on a landing spot we had never used before. We got on it and came home.\n\n\"There were tourists in the village,\" he says. \"They would have woken up and found themselves alone in the desert. The local staff were still there, but no-one else - the diving instructor, the lady manager and so on, all the Caucasians had disappeared.\"\n\nWhen the plane landed at an air-force base outside Tel Aviv, they drove out in the same vehicles they boarded with, still bearing Sudanese registration plates.\n\nIn the wake of the agents' sudden departure, the diving village shut down.\n\nFor the 492 Ethiopian Jews left stranded by the abrupt halt of Operation Moses, another airlift was engineered two months later, by then US Vice-President George Bush, and they were finally flown, by American Hercules, to Israel.\n\nOver the course of the next five years, more operations followed, bringing in total almost 18,000 Beta Israelis to begin a new life in the Jewish state.\n\nFerede Aklum was among them.\n\n\"The Ethiopian Jews are the real heroes of the story,\" says Gad, as he sipped tea in a cafe in Tel Aviv, \"not the pilots, nor the Navy Seals nor the Mossad operatives.\n\nImage copyright Raffi Berg Image caption Gad Shimron today\n\n\"When I think of what they lived through - such horrors that an ordinary person could not endure for one day.\n\n\"We just did our job.\"\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12846090", "published": "2018-04-17T23:49:26", "title": "Obituary: Barbara Bush - former US First Lady and literacy campaigner", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThe spouse of one US president and the mother of a second, Barbara Bush was never content to accept a passive role as political wife.\n\nA long-time campaigner for social justice, she spoke out against racial segregation and threw her weight behind the drive to eradicate illiteracy in America.\n\nAt times she had to tone down her more liberal views to avoid clashes with her husband's party.\n\nThis included her natural instinct to take a more pro-choice side in the abortion debate.\n\nShe was born Barbara Pierce in New York City on 8 June 1925, the daughter of a magazine publisher.\n\nIt was while she was still at school - at just 16 - that she met fellow student George Herbert Walker Bush and the couple became engaged in 1943.\n\nShortly afterwards, her fianc\u00e9 went off to serve in the US Navy as a pilot.\n\nImage copyright George Bush Presidential library Image caption Barbara married George HW Bush while still a teenager.

He eventually founded his own oil development company in 1950.\n\nFor the next nine years Barbara Bush fulfilled the role of wife and mother, while her husband built up his business.\n\nThe death of their three-year-old daughter Robin from leukaemia in 1953 inspired Mrs Bush to campaign on behalf of cancer charities. An interest in improving literacy was sparked when her son Neil was diagnosed as dyslexic.\n\nConflict\n\nShe also became aware of segregation in the South after driving across America with two African-American women in order to reach a holiday home in Maine.\n\nShe discovered, to her horror, that her two companions were not allowed to sleep or eat in the same hotels and restaurants as white people.\n\nFor the rest of her life she spoke out against racial bigotry, often finding herself in conflict with right wingers in the Republican Party.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption In the first years of her marriage she devoted herself to her family. She and George would have 6 children together.\n\nShe became a political wife in 1964 when George campaigned, unsuccessfully, to become a Republican Senator for Texas.\n\nBut, two years later, he entered Congress and his wife launched herself into political life, working for various Republican women's organisations.\n\nIn 1970, after George Bush failed for a second time to reach the Senate, President Richard Nixon appointed him US ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nBarbara Bush relished the opportunity to make new contacts among the international community and was able to widen that circle when her husband was posted to Beijing by President Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, George was appointed as Director of the CIA. It was a difficult period in Barbara's life during which she suffered from a deep depression.\n\nIn her autobiography, she recalled how she would have to stop her car on the side of a highway for fear she would deliberately crash into a tree or an on-coming vehicle.\n\n'Night after night, George held me weeping in his arms while I tried to explain my feelings,' she wrote. 'I almost wonder why he didn't leave me. I knew it was wrong, but couldn't seem to pull out of it.'\n\nShe never sought medical help for her feelings, which she put down to a combination of the menopause and the stress of her husband's job. The despair vanished after about six months.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption She relished the role of political campaigner although her views on issues like abortion were more liberal than her husband's.\n\nWhen George entered the primaries for the Republican presidential nomination, Barbara campaigned enthusiastically for him.\n\nThe couple's relatively liberal views on abortion and equal rights were at odds with the growing influence of the conservative wing of the Republican Party under Ronald Reagan.\n\nWitty speaker\n\nThe former California governor's decision to invite George Bush to be his vice presidential running mate meant Barbara had to publicly toe the party line on these issues.\n\nAs the wife of the vice president, Barbara Bush stepped up her campaign to improve adult and child literacy, putting her weight behind organisations working in the field.\n\nShe also emerged as an entertaining and witty public speaker, and her experience of two vice presidential campaigns stood her in good stead when her husband ran for the White House in 1988.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption She campaigned to eradicate illiteracy in the US\n\nWhen she appeared at the Republican convention that nominated him, she became the first wife of a candidate to speak in support of their husband.\n\nOnce in the White House she founded the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, designed to raise money for literacy programmes.\n\nShe also made regular radio appearances on a programme called Mrs Bush's Story Time, which championed the benefits of parents reading aloud to their children.\n\nShe continued her drive to improve civil rights in America and was reputed to have been influential in the appointment of the first African-American to her husband's cabinet.\n\nAvoiding clashes\n\nNot all her beliefs were shared by her husband. Her support for gun control elicited strong reaction from his supporters in the powerful National Rifle Association.\n\nAnd she toned down her relatively pro-choice views on abortion to avoid clashes with powerful groups within the party which might have threatened the stability of her husband's presidency.\n\nHowever, she returned to the subject of abortion during the 1992 campaign, stating her belief that it was a private matter and something on which the Republican Party should not take a position.\n\nHer husband failed to gain a second term in the White House, losing to Bill Clinton, and Barbara found more time to spend on her campaigns.\n\nLife outside the White House came as something of a shock to the former first Lady. She realised she hadn't cooked for 12 years and her driving had become appalling.

Throughout the campaign she harboured grave doubts that he would win.\n\nAt George W Bush's inauguration, she became the first woman in US history to have witnessed both her husband and son sworn in as President of the United States.\n\nAbigail Adams was married to the second US president, John Adams, and was the mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams, but she did not live to see their son elected.\n\nBack on the campaign trail\n\nShe was unswervingly loyal to her family but did not automatically extend that support to every member of the Republican Party.\n\nAsked in 2010 about former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Mrs Bush was damning.\n\n'I sat next to her once, thought she was beautiful,' she told an interviewer before adding 'I think she's very happy in Alaska, and I hope she'll stay there.\"\n\nIn 2013, she joked on NBC that the country had probably \"had enough Bushes\" but soon had to swallow her words when another son, Jeb Bush, announced he too would run for the Presidency.\n\nAt the age of 90, she found herself back on the campaign trail in Jeb's support - although he would ultimately be unsuccessful in his attempt to secure the Republican nomination.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption She joined her son Jeb in 2016 as he campaigned to become the Republican presidential candidate\n\nIn 2017, Barbara and her husband were given standing ovations at the 2017 Super Bowl. She also actively campaigned on behalf of the victims of hurricane Katrina.\n\nRecently, suffering from heart and respiratory disease, she decided to decline any further medical treatment and return to the family home in Houston.\n\nDuring long career in public life, Barbara Bush remained a witty and independent-minded bastion of support to her husband and son in the course of their presidencies.\n\nAs first lady, she steered a middle course between the public deference of Nancy Reagan and the more high profile role of Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd like many of her predecessors, such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Helen Taft, she found this gave her room to champion her own causes behind the scenes."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43700153", "published": "2018-04-14T23:22:19", "title": "\u2018I was a teacher for 17 years, but I couldn\u2019t read or write\u2019", "text": "Image copyright Alamy\n\nJohn Corcoran grew up in New Mexico in the US during the 1940s and 50s. One of six siblings, he graduated from high school, went on to university, and became a teacher in the 1960s - a job he held for 17 years. But, as he explains here, he hid an extraordinary secret.\n\nWhen I was a child I was told by my parents that I was a winner, and for the first six years of my life I believed what my parents had told me.\n\nI was late in talking, but I went off to school with high hopes of learning to read like my sisters, and for the first year things were fine because there weren't many demands on us other than standing in the right line, sitting down, keeping our mouths shut and going to the bathroom on time.\n\nAnd then in the second grade we were supposed to learn to read. But for me it was like opening a Chinese newspaper and looking at it - I didn't understand what those lines were, and as a child of six, seven, eight years old I didn't know how to articulate the problem.\n\nI remember praying at night and saying, \"Please Lord, let me know how to read tomorrow when I get up\" and sometimes I'd even turn on the light and get a book and look at it and see if I got a miracle. But I didn't get that miracle.\n\nAt school I ended up in the dumb row with a bunch of other kids who were having a hard time learning to read. I didn't know how I got there, I didn't know how to get out and I certainly didn't know what question to ask.\n\nThe teacher didn't call it the \"dumb row\" - there wasn't any cruelty or anything - but the kids called it the dumb row, and when you're in that dumb row you start thinking you're dumb.\n\nAt teacher conferences my teacher told my parents, \"He's a smart boy, he'll get it,\" and they moved me on to the third grade.\n\n\"He's a smart boy, he'll get it,\" and they moved me on to the fourth grade.\n\n\"He's a smart boy, he'll get it,\" and they moved me on to the fifth grade.\n\nI got up every day, got dressed, went to school and I was going to war\n\nBut I wasn't getting it.\n\nBy the time I got to the fifth grade I'd basically given up on myself in terms of reading. I got up every day, got dressed, went to school and I was going to war. I hated the classroom. It was a hostile environment and I had to find a way to survive.\n\nBy the seventh grade I was sitting in the principal's office most of the day. I was in fights, I was defiant, I was a clown, I was a disruptor, I got expelled from school.\n\nBut that behaviour wasn't who I felt inside - it wasn't who I wanted to be. I wanted to be somebody else, I had a desire to succeed, I wanted to be a good student, but I just couldn't do it.\n\nBy the time I got to the eighth grade I got tired of embarrassing myself and my family. I decided I was going to behave myself now - if you behave in high school you can find your way through the system. So I was going to be a teacher's pet and do everything necessary to pass that system.\n\nI wanted to be an athlete - I had athletic skills, and I had maths skills - I could count money and make change before I even went to school and I learned the times tables.\n\nI had social skills too - I ran around with college kids, I dated the valedictorian - the student with the highest grades who gives a speech at the graduation ceremony, I was the homecoming king, I had people - mostly girls - do my homework for me.\n\nI could write my name and there were some words that I could remember, but I couldn't write a sentence - I was in high school and reading at the second or third grade level. And I never told anybody that I couldn't read.\n\nWhen I was taking a test I would look at someone else's paper, or I'd pass my paper over to somebody else and they'd answer the questions for me - it was fairly easy, amateur cheating. But when I went off to college on a full athletic scholarship it was a different story.\n\nI thought, \"Oh my gosh, this is way over my head, how am I going to be able to get through this?\"\n\nI belonged to a social fraternity who had copies of old exam papers. That was one way to cheat. I tried to take classes with a partner, somebody who would help me through. There were professors who used the same test year after year. But I also had to resort to more creative and desperate things.\n\nOne night I went by the professor's office about midnight - I opened the window with a knife and I went in like a cat burglar\n\nIn one exam the professor put four questions on the board. I was sitting at the back of the room, near the window, behind the older students.\n\nI had my blue book and I painstakingly copied the four questions off the board. I didn't know what those questions said.\n\nI had arranged for a friend of mine to be outside the window. He was probably the smartest kid in school, but he was also shy and he'd asked me to fix him up with a girl by the name of Mary who he wanted to go to the spring formal dance with.\n\nI passed my blue book out the window to him and he answered the questions for me.\n\nI had another blue exam book underneath my shirt and I took it out and pretended I was writing in it.\n\nI was praying that my friend was going to be able to get my book back to me and that he was going to get the right answers.\n\nI was so desperate. I needed to pass courses. I was at risk.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to John Corcoran on Outlook Weekend on the BBC World Service\n\nOr download the podcast here\n\nThere was another exam that I couldn't figure out how I was going to pass.\n\nOne night I went by the professor's office about midnight, he wasn't there. I opened the window with a knife and I went in like a cat burglar. I'd crossed the line now - I wasn't just a student that was cheating, I was a criminal.\n\nWhy didn't I ask for help? Because I didn't believe there was anybody out there who could teach me to read\n\nI went inside and I looked around for the exam. It had to be in his office but I couldn't find it. There was a file cabinet that was locked - it had to be in the file cabinet.\n\nI did the same thing two or three nights in a row looking for that exam but I still couldn't find it. So one night, about one o'clock in the morning, I brought three of my friends with me and we went to the office. We carried out a four-drawer file cabinet, put it in a vehicle, and took it off campus to a college apartment.\n\nI had arranged for a locksmith to come. I put my suit and tie on - I was pretending to be a young businessman who was leaving for Los Angeles the next day and the locksmith was saving my job by opening it.\n\nHe opened it, gave me a key, and sure enough, to my great relief there were more than 40 copies of the exam - a multiple choice paper - in the top drawer of the file cabinet. I took one copy back to my dormitory, where a \"smart\" classmate made a cheat sheet with all the correct answers.\n\nWe carried the file cabinet back and at five o'clock in the morning I was walking up to my room and thinking, \"Mission impossible accomplished!\" - and I was feeling pretty good that I was so clever.\n\nBut then I walked up the stairs, lay down in my bed and started weeping like a baby.\n\nWhy didn't I ask for help? Because I didn't believe there was anybody out there who could teach me to read. This was my secret and I guarded that secret.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Corcoran tells Outlook how he hid his inability to read\n\nMy teachers and my parents told me that people with college degrees get better jobs, they have better lives, and so that's what I believed. My motivation was to just get that piece of paper. Maybe by osmosis, maybe by prayer, maybe by a miracle I would one day learn to read.\n\nSo I graduated from college, and when I graduated there was a teacher shortage and I was offered a job. It was the most illogical thing you can imagine - I got out of the lion's cage and then I got back in to taunt the lion again.\n\nWhy did I go into teaching? Looking back it was crazy that I would do that. But I'd been through high school and college without getting caught - so being a teacher seemed a good place to hide. Nobody suspects a teacher of not knowing how to read.\n\nI taught a lot of different things. I was an athletics coach. I taught social studies. I taught typing - I could copy-type at 65 words a minute but I didn't know what I was typing. I never wrote on a blackboard and there was no printed word in my classroom. We watched a lot of films and had a lot of discussions.\n\nI remember how fearful I was. I couldn't even take the roll - I had to ask the students to pronounce their names so I could hear their names. And I always had two or three students who I identified early - the ones who could read and write best in the classroom - to help me. They were my teaching aides. They didn't suspect at all - you don't suspect the teacher.\n\nOne of my biggest fears was faculty meetings. We had them once a week and if the teachers were brainstorming the principal would call on somebody to get those ideas on to the board. I lived in fear that he would call on me, every week I was terrified, but I had a backup plan.\n\nIf he had called on me I was going to get out of my chair and take two steps, grab my chest, drop to the floor and hope they called 911. Whatever it took not to get caught, and I never got caught.\n\nSometimes I felt like a good teacher - because I worked hard at it and I really cared about what I was doing - but I wasn't. It was wrong. I didn't belong in the classroom, I was trespassing. I wasn't supposed to be there and sometimes what I was doing made me physically sick, but I was trapped, I couldn't tell anybody.\n\nI got married while I was a teacher. Getting married is a sacrament, it's a commitment to be truthful with another person and this was the first time I thought, \"OK, I'm going to trust this person, I'm going to tell her.\"\n\nI practised in front of the mirror: \"Cathy, I can't read. Cathy, I can't read.\"\n\nAnd one evening we were sitting on the couch and I said, \"Cathy, I can't read.\"\n\nBut she didn't really understand what I was saying. She thought I was saying that I didn't read much.\n\nYou know, love is blind and deaf.\n\nMy daughter said, 'You're not reading it like mama'\n\nSo we got married and we had a child and years later it really came home to her.\n\nI was reading to our three-year-old daughter. We read to her routinely, but I wasn't really reading, I was making the stories up - stories that I knew, like Goldilocks and The Three Bears, I just added drama to them.\n\nBut this was a new book, Rumpelstiltskin, and my daughter said, \"You're not reading it like mama.\"\n\nMy wife heard me trying to read from a child's book and that was the first time that it dawned on her. I had been asking her to do all this writing for me, helping me write things for school, and then she finally realised, how deep and severe this was.\n\nBut nothing was said, there was no confrontation, she just carried on helping me get by.\n\nImage caption John Corcoran and his granddaughter, Kayla Mertes: It was when \"reading\" to his daughter that John's secret was revealed\n\nIt didn't relieve anything because in my gut I felt dumb and I felt like a fake. I was deceitful. I was teaching my students to be seekers of truth and I was the biggest liar in the room. The relief only came when I finally learned to read.\n\nI taught high school from 1961 to 1978. Eight years after I quit my teaching job, something finally changed.\n\nI was 47 going on 48 when I saw Barbara Bush - then Second Lady of the US - talking about adult literacy on TV. It was her special cause. I'd never heard anybody talking about adult literacy before, I thought I was the only person in the world that was in the situation I was in.\n\nI was at this desperate spot in my life. I wanted to tell somebody and I wanted to get help and one day in the grocery store I was standing in line and there were two women in front of me talking about their adult brother who was going to the library. He was learning to read and they were just full of joy and I couldn't believe it.\n\nSo one Friday afternoon in my pinstriped suit I walked into the library and asked to see the director of the literacy programme and I sat down with her and I told her I couldn't read.\n\nThat was the second person in my adult life that I had ever told.\n\nImage caption Barbara Bush inspired John Corcoran to ask for help and finally learn to read\n\nI had a volunteer tutor - she was 65 years old. She wasn't a teacher, she was just somebody who loved to read and didn't think anybody should go through life without knowing how to.\n\nAdults who can't read are suspended in their childhoods\n\nOne of the things that she had me do in the early stages was to try to write because I had all these thoughts in my mind and I'd never written a sentence. The first thing that I wrote was a poem about my feelings. One of the things about poetry is that you don't have to know what a complete sentence is, and you don't have to write in complete sentences.\n\nShe got me to about sixth-grade-level reading - I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. But it took me about seven years to feel like I was a literate person. I cried, I cried, and I cried after I started learning to read - there was a lot of pain and a lot of frustration - but it filled a big hole in my soul. Adults who can't read are suspended in their childhoods, emotionally, psychologically, academically, spiritually. We haven't grown up yet.\n\nI was encouraged to tell my story by my tutor to motivate others and promote literacy, but I said, \"No way. I've lived in this community for 17 years, my children are here, my wife is here - she's a professional, my parents are here, I'm not going to tell this story.\"\n\nImage caption John Corcoran and members of his family today\n\nBut eventually I decided I would. It was an embarrassing secret and it was a shame-based secret, so it was a big decision.\n\nIt wasn't easy but once I'd made up my mind I was going to tell the story I told it all across America, I spoke to anybody that would listen. I guarded this secret for decades and then I blasted it to the world.\n\nI was on Larry King, I was on the ABC News magazine show 20/20, I was on Oprah.\n\nIf you know someone who needs help\n\nJohn Corcoran set up a foundation in his name to help adults and children with literacy skills - in California and online\n\nIn the UK the National Literacy Trust website lists organisations that promote adult literacy\n\nThese include Read Easy and the Reading Agency\n\nIt was uncomfortable for people to hear the story of the teacher who couldn't read. Some people said it was impossible and that I was making the whole story up.\n\nBut I want people to know there is hope, there is a solution. We are not \"dumb\", we can learn to read, it's never too late.\n\nUnfortunately we are still pushing children and teens through school without teaching them basic reading and writing skills. But we can break this cycle of failure if instead of blaming teachers we make sure they are properly trained.\n\nFor 48 years I was in the dark. But I finally got the monkey off my back, I finally buried the ghost of my past.\n\nWritten by Sarah McDermott.

Now Susan Kigula wants to go further and set up the first legal chambers staffed by lawyers behind bars.\n\nWhat's about to happen next in a small, wooden panelled courtroom in Kampala, will be written up by the local press as a melodramatic confession to a gruesome murder.\n\nStanding in the dock one afternoon in November 2011, Susan Kigula is about to let the weight of the past 11 years on death row get to her as she turns to her stepson.\n\n\"Don't you know that I love you so much?\" she'll cry to the 14-year-old boy who is sitting with her late partner's family just feet away.\n\nThe courtroom will be deadly silent as Kigula falls to her knees.\n\n\"You know that I do love you so much?\" she'll repeat. \"I'm your mother!\"\n\nAnd then, turning to the family of her late partner, Susan Kigula will say sorry.\n\nThe local press in Uganda will write it up as if it was a scene in a soap opera. A hammy admittance of a horrific crime.\n\nExcept that's not what she meant, she says.\n\n\"The press lied.\"\n\nYou didn't confess to the murder of your partner, Constantine Sseremba?\n\n\"No, dear,\" Kigula's voice is calm. She's been asked this question too many times to be offended. \"I'll tell you my truth.\"\n\nKigula was born in the Central Ugandan cattle-farming town of Masaka, about 134km (84 miles) south-west of Kampala.\n\n\"Growing up I was a daddy's girl,\" she says. \"I used to tell him that I wanted to work in a bank because I thought that was a good job and I would be strong and independent if I had a good job. I had a lot of dreams back then because my parents made me believe they could all come true.\"\n\nShe and her three brothers and five sisters enjoyed a sheltered middle-class upbringing, centred around a close-knit church community. The children played in the open fields into the evening and ate together with their parents every night.\n\n\"My happy childhood didn't prepare me for what was to come in adulthood,\" she says simply.\n\nImage copyright Susan Kigula Image caption 20-year-old Susan Kigula with her partner Constantine Sseremba and their child - she says they enjoyed a happy relationship\n\nKigula had been working for a couple of years in a small gift shop in Kampala when she met Constantine Sseremba, who, at 28, was 10 years her senior.\n\nThey moved in together. The apartment was small, just two rooms, but Kigula says it was ideal for the family, which included Sseremba's young son from a previous relationship. They soon had a daughter of their own.\n\n\"We loved each very much,\" says Kigula. \"We would go to the cinema and the park and people would tease us. They would call us twins because we were so in sync. We were not rich but we were happy that we had each other.\n\n\"We saw the best in our situation and we didn't dwell on the negative.\"\n\nIt's an outlook that, many years later, would save her life.\n\nThe 9 July 2000 could have been another forgettable evening, says Kigula.\n\nThe young family ate dinner together. They laughed.\n\nKigula and Sseremba, his son and their daughter retired to bed. They slept all together in the only bedroom. Their housemaid, Patience Nansamba, was on a mattress in the living area next door.\n\nKigula says that she was woken up around 2.30am by a piercing, flashing blow to the back of her neck.\n\n\"There was hot blood oozing from a wound there. The sheets were wet with blood. It wasn't just mine.\n\n\"Because the main lights were off I couldn't immediately take in the scene or see what was happening to us. I sat up dizzily on the bed in confusion.\n\n\"Then a small panel of light from the security lanterns outside came on and some of the room was lit. The children were unharmed. They were awake and distressed.\n\n\"Constantine was on the floor, groaning. His neck was cut. It was all happening so quickly.\n\n\"Our housemaid Patience ran into the room saying she had seen two people run out of the flat moments earlier.\n\n\"My vision was blurring and I was unsteady on my feet as I made my way outside to alert the neighbours to come help us. I saw a couple of figures running away, but they could have been anyone at this point, I can't be sure they were my attackers.\n\n\"I made it to a restaurant outside where I was given a blanket, I hadn't realised that I had run out of the house naked.\n\n\"I was still bleeding and then my vision started blurring. I passed out.\"\n\nImage copyright Susan Kigula Image caption Constantine Sseremba and his daughter Namata\n\nKigula woke up hours later in hospital, the wound to the back of her neck still throbbing, to hear that her partner had died. She was told that her family were looking after their one-year-old daughter Namata and Sseremba's relatives, with whom she had a frosty relationship, had taken his three-year-old son into their home.\n\nIt dawned on her that up until that moment she had lived a happy life; a contented childhood, a successful relationship, a good job. That was all gone now, she thought.\n\nKigula's father informed her that the families had arranged Sseremba's burial for the following day.\n\n\"My mind was a whirlwind. I couldn't understand what had happened or why. Whoever had come to attack us was targeting both of us. Who wanted me and Constantine dead? I thought about it a lot. It bothers me still.\"\n\nThere was no obvious motive for the attack. Nothing had been stolen.\n\nAfter Sseremba's funeral, Kigula was being driven back to the hospital when she heard an announcement on the radio that made her freeze.\n\nThe news reader announced that Constantine Sseremba and his 21-year-old partner, Susan Kigula, had both been murdered in a bungled burglary.\n\n\"I thought, 'Oh my god, the person who tried to kill us both had arranged a joint obituary assuming we would both be dead by now. They thought they'd get us both.'\"\n\nImage copyright Susan Kigula Image caption Susan Kigula was 21 when she entered Luzira Women's Prison in Kampala\n\nThen, three days later, Kigula, still receiving treatment for her large neck wound, received a visit from the police. To her amazement, they charged her with murder and took her straight to a maximum security prison on the outskirts of Kampala, to await trial.\n\nSseremba's family said that her three-year-old stepson had seen Kigula and the housemaid kill his father.\n\n\"I was naive in that moment,\" says Kigula. \"I thought, 'Obviously all of this is a mistake. The poor young boy is traumatised and confused. I'm innocent and of course people will see that.' I had no idea how the legal system worked.\"\n\nShe didn't hire a lawyer. She couldn't afford one and, anyway, she was confident in the justice system.\n\nBut two years later, Susan Kigula and Patience Nansamba were found guilty of the murder of Constantine Sseremba - based on the testimony of Sseremba's now five-year-old son. Police also said that a blood-stained panga, a machete-like farming tool that was found in the doorway to the bedroom of the flat belonged to Kigula.\n\nThe murder conviction came with a mandatory death sentence. The women were told the method would be hanging.\n\nKigula looked at her now three-year-old daughter, sitting with her parents, and burst into tears.\n\nIt was 2005 and 20-year-old British student Alexander McLean was taking a break from his studies, after obtaining a law degree.\n\nAfter finishing school, a few years earlier, McLean had volunteered at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, hoping to bolster his CV for university, and had been deeply disturbed by the dire conditions there. He saw patients lying on unswept floors, often in pools of vomit and blood.\n\nTheir families were required to provide fresh sheets and towels, but when the patients were prisoners, relatives often left them to fend for themselves.\n\nMcLean found himself drawn to these patients, some of whom were handcuffed to their beds. Curious about the conditions they faced in custody, he visited Luzira Upper Prison.\n\n\"I was struck by how massively overcrowded it was, how young the inmates were, how few had had decent legal representation,\" he says.\n\nA particularly gruesome, and avoidable, death of a young male prisoner in the jail prompted McLean, on his return to London, to raise money for healthcare facilities for prisoners in Uganda. He set up the African Prisons Project.\n\nWhen he returned to Uganda in 2005 to oversee the refurbishing of the sick bay at Luzira Women's Prison, Susan Kigula began to act as his translator. She made an instant impression on him.\n\nImage copyright African Prisons Project Image caption Alexander McLean was 18 when he first started working with prisoners in Uganda\n\nBy this time Kigula had been in the prison for five years.\n\n\"Every day I would wake up and think, 'Is this the day that I will be hanged?'\" she says.\n\nBut when asked what conditions were like her response is unemotional.\n\n\"Prison is prison,\" she says, without expanding.\n\nKigula shared a cell built for one person with three other women. They used a bucket as toilet.\n\nA 2011 report into Ugandan prisons by Human Rights Watch said prisoners often slept on one shoulder, packed together so that they could only shift if an entire row agreed to roll at once. Inmates were sometimes confined in isolation cells, the report said, often naked, handcuffed, and sometimes denied food; the cells occasionally flooded with water up to ankle height.\n\nKigula doesn't want to talk about such things. But she is keen to tell the story of how she obtained her freedom.\n\nI decided, 'We have to do something. We have to change our attitudes.' So I started by forgiving the people who put me in prison.\n\nFor the first few weeks in prison Kigula, then aged 24, and the 50 or so women in her section would talk to each other about their impending death, about who would care for their children outside.\n\n\"As I got to know the women I began to learn that many of them, like me, had been wrongly accused of crimes. Some were guilty but none of them deserved to be sentenced to death because the crimes they had committed were crimes of passion, they told me. Some of the crimes were a result of years of sexual and physical abuse by partners. I became a leader among the prisoners. I decided, 'We have to do something. We have to change our attitudes.' So I started by forgiving the people who put me in prison. I encouraged the other women to do the same. Then I decided to get to work.\"\n\nImage copyright Jan Banning Image caption Susan Kigula in Luzira Women's Prison in 2013\n\nKigula mobilised a choir, she wrote songs, she started playing netball and led the prison dance troupe. To keep her spirits up, she spent more time with positive thinking inmates.\n\nShe learned that the men in the neighbouring wing had access to education whereas women prisoners did not. She asked the prison administration if a small group of them could take courses in History, Economics, Divinity and Management at secondary school level.\n\nThe Acting Commissioner for Welfare and Rehabilitation asked Kigula how she planned to operate a school without teachers.\n\n\"Let me try and be the teacher to start with,\" she replied.\n\nThey used textbooks donated by their families and the prison wardens connected them to the school in the men's prison, which started sending the women study notes to help them. They held their classes under trees.\n\nWhen the wardens saw the women were dedicated, they expanded the resources and allowed more classes, with Kigula and some of her friends playing a leading role. Kigula says the prison wardens would provide support and encouragement.\n\nAnother motivating voice came from Alexander McLean, the young British founder of African Prisons Project, who had returned to oversee the refurbishment of the sick bay - a project that resulted in a sharp decline in deaths of inmates (from 114 the year before the refurbishment to 12 in the year of completion).\n\n\"I saw that Susan was dynamic, she mobilised and motivated people,\" says McLean. \"She had great humility - she would kneel down to speak to the prison wardens, which is the custom at that prison. She never tired of serving others.\"\n\nMcLean had been working with Ugandan authorities to improve conditions beyond the sick bay too. His organisation sponsored sports activities, ran mother-and-baby reading groups and adult literacy classes. Kigula acted as an intermediary between the charity and the prison authorities on a project to open a prison library.\n\nImage copyright Jan Banning Image caption Susan Kigula arranged for the female prisoners in Luzira to have classes\n\nIn 2011 Kigula and a group of other prisoners, supported by African Prisons Project, became the first Ugandan prisoners to take a correspondence course with the University of London, studying law.\n\nThe project was a huge success. As time went on, prison staff would come to her for legal advice.\n\nThen Kigula started a legal clinic in prison to help fellow inmates with bail applications, writing memorandums of appeal for them, and teaching them how to represent themselves in court, if they couldn't afford a lawyer. She helped dozens of inmates get released from prison.\n\nEmboldened by her academic success, Kigula decided, even before she completed her University of London degree, to organise a petition challenging Uganda's mandatory death sentence. The process would take years.\n\n\"The Ugandan public is generally very conservative and reluctant to see what could be perceived as a softening of the law with respect to criminal justice matters,\" says McLean.\n\nSusan Kigula and 417 Others vs Attorney General is a landmark case. The petitioners, all on death row, aimed to abolish capital punishment by declaring it unconstitutional.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court of Uganda gave its ruling, on 21 January 2009, it did not abolish the death penalty. However it did rule that a sentence of death should not be mandatory in cases of murder, and that a condemned person should not be kept on death row indefinitely - if a convict is not executed within three years, the sentence is automatically turned into life imprisonment. And, in light of these changes, the Supreme Court ruled that death-row inmates could go back to the High Court for retrial.\n\nKigula would have another day in court.\n\nIt was at this moment, in November 2011, that she called out to her stepson, using the word \"sorry\". But Kigula says this was not a confession - as the press chose to interpret it - it was an expression of regret for what he had been through. She still proclaimed her innocence, pleading not-guilty to murder for a second time, but the court - and the media - were not convinced.\n\nThe High Court reduced Kigula's sentence to 20 years, and with four taken off for her time in remand, Kigula was released from prison in 2016.\n\nTo begin with, it felt like an alien, new world.\n\n\"It was like I was walking on the moon! I could not believe what was happening to me,\" she says.\n\nHer father had died while she was in prison and her mother had been killed in a road accident just two months before her release.\n\nImage copyright Isaac Kasamani/ BBC Image caption Susan Kigula is now reunited with her 19-year-old daughter\n\nKigula now has new goals.\n\nShe wants authorities to reduce the sentence of the remaining 417 inmates from her petition - although dozens were released, like her, some are still behind bars.\n\nWorking with Alexander McLean and African Prisons Project, Kigula plans to establish the world's first prison-based legal college and law firm, where prisoner lawyers would represent peers who can not afford legal help.\n\n\"The hope is to create a new generation of servant lawyers who follow in the footsteps of Susan and the others who pioneered this alongside her,\" says Alexander McLean. \"The legal system in Uganda is not like the UK's.\"\n\n\"People can be put in prison for being gay, women are on death row for not being able to get care for a sick child in rural areas, or if their husbands commit crimes and can't be found. Of course there are guilty people in prison but we believe that everyone deserves due process. We believe everyone deserves a second chance to be of use to society. Susan has always maintained her innocence and she wants to serve her community.\"\n\nKigula now lives with her sister and her 19-year-old daughter.\n\n\"My daughter calls me her hero. That was all I needed to hear after 16 years away from her.\"\n\nLife is good again, she says.\n\nFollow Megha Mohan on Twitter @meghamohan\n\nYou may also like:\n\nImage copyright Remand /Revolution Pictures\n\nUgandan teenager Tumusiime Henry was in jail charged with two murders when he met American lawyer who offered to help.\n\nThe schoolboy wrongly accused of two murders\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-43499374", "published": "2018-03-27T00:57:38", "title": "Secret world: The women in the UK who cannot report sexual abuse", "text": "They often fled their homelands to escape sexual abuse - but for many asylum seekers, it continues in the UK. Fear of deportation typically means they don't tell police, but one effect of the Harvey Weinstein revelations is that they have now begun to talk about their experiences among themselves.\n\nAt the age of 37, Grace has never had consensual sex.\n\n\"I am not the only one. There are many more women like me,\" she says, hunched over and looking down at the table. She indicates to the wall that separates the small meeting room from her friends in the adjacent room.\n\n\"We are the most destitute and vulnerable women in the UK.\"\n\nTo her it makes sense that destitution and exploitation go hand in hand - it's happened all her life.\n\nGrace arrived in London at the age of 17, back in 1998. She was born in West Africa, but doesn't want to reveal the country for fear of endangering her relatives.\n\n\"I came from a very, very poor family,\" she tells me.\n\nSo poor that at the age of 15, Grace and her 17-year-old-sister were both married off to a man older than their father - in exchange for a dowry. They moved into a palatial house in the capital city with his five other wives.\n\nFor the first time the sisters didn't have to worry about their next meal, but that was the only thing they didn't have to worry about.\n\n\"It wasn't a good life. I suffered a lot,\" she says. It quickly becomes clear this is a massive understatement.\n\nGrace and her sister were subjected to continuous physical, verbal and sexual abuse by their husband. They were also made to take part in superstitious ritual ceremonies that he believed would advance his political career - including drinking animal blood, she says with a shudder.\n\nThe young women relied on each other for support, afraid that if they spoke out their family would be harmed.\n\n\"Our husband was a powerful man,\" Grace says.\n\nAfter two years of marriage, Grace and her sister reached breaking point. They confided in a sympathetic uncle who said he would help them leave the country - it would be assumed that they had run away, he said, and no-one would admit to having helped them. He arranged short-stay visas, took them to the airport and presented them with one-way tickets to London.\n\nThe uncle had an old friend who would pick them up from Heathrow airport, he told his nieces. A good man who would take care of them.\n\n\"When we arrived at the airport there was a man standing there holding up a sign with our names,\" says Grace. \"He looked like death standing up.\"\n\nTheir uncle's friend was suffering from cancer. He hadn't revealed this before, he said, because he was keen to do a favour for his friend and to provide the sisters with temporary sanctuary.\n\nHe told Grace and her sister, who were now 17 and 19, that his cancer was terminal, and that as he was not a wealthy man he wouldn't be able to provide for them after his death. Instead he would introduce them to friends at his local church, mostly other West African immigrants, who would help them with accommodation.\n\nHe died three weeks later, and as he had predicted, Grace and her sister - who had no legal right to work in the UK - moved in with families they met through the church.\n\n\"Migrant families in this country, who are themselves poor and working long hours look for young, single women to look after the children and do the cooking and household chores,\" says Grace. \"My sister and I moved in with different families. We were reliant on them for food, clothes. For everything.\"\n\nGrace didn't have her own room. She slept on the sofa in the living room, waiting until everyone in the family was ready for bed before getting any rest herself. She had little privacy and made sure not to disturb the family.\n\nShe soon discovered how unsafe she was.\n\n\"The man of the house would come down at night when everyone was asleep. He began using me for sexual pleasure,\" she says. \"He knew I was destitute and had nowhere to go. I knew nothing about the legal system then. I couldn't go to the police because I was scared I will be detained or deported. I was at his mercy. He would say, 'Who are you going to tell?'\n\n\"I couldn't talk to his wife about it. I was worried that if she didn't believe me she would throw me out of the house. What could I do in my situation? I'd look outside. London always seemed liked it was winter, and I'd think, 'What can I do? Nothing.'\"\n\nHer sister, Grace learned, was in a similar situation. They were both trapped. But there were bigger problems ahead.\n\nWhen the family's children grew to school age, Grace was informed that she was no longer needed and that she would have to leave. While waiting for another family from the church to take her, and relying on friends for odd meals, Grace slept on park benches and on night buses.\n\nShe has lived in more than a dozen homes during 20 years in the UK and in nearly all she has been sexually abused.\n\nAnd the sexual abuse has continued from one family to the next.\n\n\"I slept on floors and sofas. If there were male overnight visitors I would almost always be violated by them. Often men would come to my room at night and they would touch me. Or more.\n\n\"At night I would try and jam the door with drawers to try and stop the men getting in. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. In the morning in front of their wife and children they acted like nothing had happened.\n\n\"This didn't happen just once or twice with one or two families. It happened many, many times.\"\n\nIn 2008, a tragedy occurred. Grace's sister had been talking to a man she had met on an internet chatroom. She told Grace that she would be going to meet him.\n\nShe didn't return.\n\n\"I was in hell,\" Grace says.\n\nShe called hospitals and asked friends who had a more secure status in the UK to go to the police to file a missing person's report. So far, no information has emerged. Grace has not heard from her sister in 10 years.\n\nFeeling more alone than ever, Grace continued shuffling between families and homes, until five years ago when once again a family told her they would no longer need her services. And this time no other families came forward with an offer of work.\n\n\"I was homeless. For weeks I was sleeping on park benches or, if I was scared of being alone, I would go on to a night bus and ride all night.\n\n\"I'd spend the day begging for change or go sit in libraries or in parks.\"\n\nThen one day, Grace says, a miracle occurred.\n\n\"A man came up to me in the park. I'd met him when I first moved to the UK. He said 'You've aged, Grace.' I said, 'Yes, I know.'\n\n\"Then he said, 'There are people who can help you Grace.' I said, 'I'm a slave, who can help me?' He said, 'There are places and people who will help. I will take you somewhere.'\"\n\nHe took her to a central London refugee centre, where staff listened carefully to her story and offered help to solve her problems.\n\nImage caption Most of the women who attend Women for Refugee Women have experienced abuse\n\nIt was a typical cold October day in London when Marchu Girma stood in front of a room of 35 sub-Saharan African asylum seekers, including Grace, and told about them the news that had been making headlines around the world.\n\nNumerous household-name actresses had stepped forward to accuse the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of being a sexual predator. The story achieved the rare combination of going viral on social media, and dominating both mainstream news coverage and dining-table chatter. Thousands of women - from all professions - shared their own tales of abuse and harassment they had faced at the hands of powerful men. They used the hashtag #MeToo.\n\n\"I remember the moment in the classroom when I told the women about Me Too,\" says Girma. \"It was an 'oh' moment. There was a sudden realisation that they weren't alone. There was a sudden realisation in the room that sexual harassment had even happened to white, powerful, famous and important women.\n\n\"It was no longer a shameful secret they had to keep to themselves.\"\n\nGirma is the grassroots director for Women For Refugee Women, a small organisation for women seeking asylum in the UK. Originally from Ethiopia, Girma herself went through the UK asylum process at the age of 11.\n\n\"Women find us through word of mouth,\" she says. \"They tell each other about Women For Refugee Women at church, at detention centres, through other charities. This is a protected and private space for them. All the women that come to us are within the system, they are part of the legal asylum-seeking process. They're looking for solidarity.\"\n\nOnce a week the women come seeking advice, lunch and classes such as English, craft, drama and empowerment.\n\nIt was at an empowerment class that Girma told them about Me Too.\n\nThen, for the first time, the women talked about the abuse they had suffered. Many said that sexual harassment was not just something they fled in the countries of origin, but a reality of their life here in the UK.\n\nOne woman described a time she cleaned a house for a client who ordered her to strip to her underwear first. Others, like Grace, had stories of sexual violence within their informal living arrangements.\n\n\"The asylum process is flawed and works against a victim of sexual harassment or abuse at many stages,\" says Girma.\n\n\"If you don't have legal status you are not considered a person in the eyes of the law. You are not really a human being.\n\n\"These women have endured a prolonged and continual cycle of abuse - fleeing sexual violence and walking straight into a life of abuse while in the UK.\"\n\nThe situation is worst for those who are living in the country without having applied for asylum.\n\n\"Currently there is data-sharing between police and UK immigration officers and we have heard of cases where women go to report abuse and are held in detention centres or even deported back to the countries they came from, and the deadly situations they were trying to escape. The current system prevents these women from reporting sexual violence and the predators know this,\" Girma says.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Migration Observatory there are hundreds of thousands of undocumented or \"irregular\" migrants in the UK.\n\nBut even women who have applied for asylum and have legal status in the UK may be unsure of their rights, says Girma, and hesitant to approach police.\n\nImage caption Marchu Girma from Women For Refugee Women\n\nIt's been 10 years but Grace's friend, Yanelle, still dreams about the worst night of her life.\n\nA political dissident in West Africa, she was arrested, thrown in prison and then gang-raped at gunpoint by a group of police officers.\n\nAfter she was released, friends within her political party helped her come to London. She moved in with friends initially, then found work through families at a local church.\n\nLike Grace, Yanelle received a roof over her head and food in exchange for childcare and cleaning.\n\nShe filed immediately for refugee status, but received bad legal advice and her first application was declined.\n\nYet Yanelle was luckier than Grace, she says.\n\nHer landlords may have groped her, but they did not coerce her into having sex.\n\nWhen one said, \"What are you going to do? Who are you going to tell? If I did something and you report me, the police will detain you and send you back,\" she didn't consider it sexual harassment.\n\nIt wasn't until years later, when she had worked and lived with many other families, and had repelled dozens more advances by other landlords, that her thinking changed. And this happened that day in October, when she and Grace sat in the empowerment class at Women For Refugee Women, hearing stories about Hollywood actresses speaking out.\n\nMaybe a man making persistent advances without her consent and touching her body wasn't something to dismiss as insignificant, she thought.\n\n\"We never talked about the abuse before Me Too. From the culture I come from it is not common to discuss sexual harassment so freely. But when we saw important women speaking out it changed our mentality. We learned that we all had some experience of harassment,\" Yanelle says.\n\n\"It does seem like we, as women, are at a moment in history where real global change is possible. It's important that this change is extended to the most vulnerable women in our societies,\" says Marchu Girma,\n\n\"We need collective will, and the sisterhood and solidarity must reach down here to women like Grace and Yanelle too.\"\n\nAt the age of 37, Grace has ambitions to pass her GCSEs. She wants to help people. She hopes she can qualify as a midwife. She now lives with a \"lovely couple\" in their 80s with whom she was housed through a refugee-hosting programme. She still has no legal right to work in the UK and no income. She gets her meals from a food bank and wears donated clothes.\n\nShe hopes she will one day find her sister. She also hopes that she will soon receive asylum - she has made three applications since 2013 without receiving a final refusal, and is now on her fourth. The difficulty is proving that she has been in the country for 20 years, because she has no paperwork.\n\nBut she's hopeful. She has friends who she can talk to - and they listen, she says.\n\nYanelle is also re-applying for refugee status. She still dreams about the gang-rape in the police cell in West Africa, but since she heard about Me Too, she shouts back at the rapists and tells them to leave her alone. Sometimes they back away and leave her cell. Sometimes, in her dreams, they don't rape her at all.\n\nPhotos by Emma Lynch\n\nAll names have been changed\n\nFollow Megha Mohan on Twitter @meghamohan\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter"}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43420999", "published": "2018-04-11T21:26:46", "title": "Americans going abroad for illegal heroin treatment", "text": "Image copyright Jonathan Levinson/PRI Image caption Emily Albert begins her treatment to try and end years of opioid and heroin abuse\n\nAs America's opioid and heroin crisis rages, some struggling with addiction are turning to a drug illegal in the US. Jonathan Levinson went to one clinic offering the treatment in Mexico.\n\nAt the end of a dead end street in a town near the US-Mexico border, Emily Albert is in the basement of a drug treatment clinic, hallucinating about her son as a heroin addict. She imagines him going through rehab and desperately trying to get clean.\n\nBut Albert is the one with the addiction. She's in the middle of a psychedelic treatment for opioid addiction.\n\nThrough tears after the treatment is over, Albert recalls the vision of her son.\n\n\"I could just tell that he was older and going through whatever I'm going through,\" she explains. \"It was like, basically, if I don't do this then he's going to have to.\"\n\nAlbert is among a growing number of opioid addicts from the US going to clinics in Mexico to get treated with a psychedelic drug called ibogaine.\n\nThe drug is illegal in the US, but several studies have suggested it is effective in alleviating opioid withdrawals and curbing addiction.\n\nAnd unlike daily replacement therapies like buprenorphine or methadone, ibogaine only requires a one-time treatment.\n\nIbogaine risks and legality\n\nIbogaine has been associated with at least 19 deaths. Given it is largely unregulated, the actual toll could be much higher\n\nIn New Zealand, the only country to have regulated the drug, the medical advisory board Medsafe reported that \"the number of deaths due to methadone, the most controlled substance, were a little higher that those associated with ibogaine\"\n\nIbogaine is illegal in the US, France, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Croatia and Switzerland and strongly restricted in the UK under the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act\n\nIbogaine, along with other hallucinogenics, such as LSD and psilocybin (magic mushrooms), are schedule I substances in the US - drugs which have no medical application and are not safe for use, even under medical supervision.\n\nThe drug's side effects include hallucinations, of course, but also seizures and in rare cases, potentially fatal cardiac complications.\n\nStill, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the FDA's label isn't accurate.\n\n\"Essentially, it's because of the backlash against the psychedelic '60s,\" says Dr Thomas Kingsley Brown, an anthropologist and chemist at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nIn a study spanning eight years, funded by the Multidisciplinary Association on Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, Brown tracked outcomes for addicts who were treated with ibogaine.\n\n\"About 90% of the people in the study had a dramatic reduction in their withdrawal symptoms at the point when you'd expect they'd be at their worst,\" he says.\n\nBrown says the severity of their addictions were reduced throughout a 12-month follow-up period and their relationships with family and loved ones improved as well.\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Levinson/PRI Image caption Staff at the clinic look out over the coast, where whales are swimming\n\nTwo days after her own ibogaine treatment, Albert is sitting on a deck at the clinic overlooking the Pacific Ocean when it dawns on her that she hasn't even thought about getting high in two days.\n\nThat hasn't happened in 10 years.\n\n\"It's like they took my addiction and put it in an elevator and sent it a hundred floors down,\" she says.\n\nWhen Albert was 14, she had minor surgery on her big toe after a basketball injury. The doctor prescribed Percocet for the pain.\n\n\"I remember the very first time I tried one. I didn't know if it was the antibiotics my mom had given me or what it was from those bottles, but I was like 'that is great. I'm going to figure out what that was.'\"\n\nOver the next few days she tried one, then another. When she finally figured it out, she says, \"it was game over from there\".\n\nShe quickly went from pills to heroin. And when she had to worry about passing drug tests she'd huff cans of compressed air - sometimes up to 16 cans a day.\n\nBecause ibogaine is illegal in the US and not well known, the people with addiction who end up in Mexico seeking treatment are typically there as a last resort.\n\nTwo days before Albert's treatment she was coming off a stretch of homelessness, barricaded in a hotel room north of San Diego. She wasn't answering the door or her phone and an employee from the clinic, sent to pick her up, feared she might have overdosed.\n\nWhen she finally did answer, a brief stand-off ensued.\n\n\"She's going to have to leave with you or leave with the police,\" Thom Leonard, who owns the clinic, told the employee over the phone.\n\nShe chose rehab.\n\nTreatment at this clinic costs between $5,000 and $12,000, depending on the length of stay and programme. Emily's parents ended up paying for her treatment, but Leonard says he does discounts and pro-bono treatments for those who can't afford to pay. Those who pay full price subsidise those efforts.\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Levinson/PRI Image caption Emily Albert is hooked up to an EKG before she begins her ibogaine treatment\n\nWhile this clinic has a good reputation among independent researchers, ibogaine treatment clinics in Mexico and elsewhere are unregulated, making it difficult to determine the level of medical knowledge and safety on offer.\n\nAnd while Ibogaine shows promise, it comes with risks. People have died while taking it.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2008, 19 people are known to have died within 72 hours of taking Ibogaine. Researchers at NYU looked at autopsy and toxicological data from those deaths and found that most patients had pre-existing cardiac or liver conditions, or still had opioids in their system, all of which are contraindications for Ibogaine.\n\nA 2015 review found similar issues in three additional deaths, and reports of dangerously slow heart rate associated with taking the drug.\n\nAnd so the morning after she arrived, Albert was taken to get blood tests and an EKG exam to make sure she was healthy enough for treatment.\n\nThat night, in a dimly lit room, a nurse inserted an IV, hooked Albert up to an EKG for monitoring throughout her treatment. Then a doctor gave her three ibogaine pills.\n\nWith calming, instrumental music playing, Albert appeared to fall asleep.\n\nAside from the occasional bathroom break or scream you might expect to hear from someone having a bad dream, she stayed like that for more than 24 hours.\n\nMeanwhile she was experiencing vivid hallucinations.\n\n\"There was a childhood memory that I didn't know was there,\" she recalled. \"It kept going around and around and every time I'd get a little more.\"\n\nLeonard says that's an important part of the process.\n\nImage copyright Jonathan Levinson/Public Radio International Image caption Thom Leonard outside his clinic\n\n\"You revisit your traumas, but you see them from a new perspective. And you get to make peace with these things - or at least move past them.\"\n\nThe science behind ibogaine's efficacy in treating addiction is up for debate.\n\nA 2008 study in mice by neurologist Dorit Ron found ibogaine increased the level of a brain protein called GDNF, which prevents the development of addiction.\n\nThere are drugs that mimic some of ibogaine's effects.\n\nSavant HWP, an American pharmaceutical company, is scheduled to begin human trials next year on a drug called 18-MC, which claims to have ibogaine's desirable effect on addiction - without the hallucinogenic component.\n\nBut people familiar with ibogaine's use in treating addiction believe the psychedelic experience is critical to the treatment.\n\nBrown says the drug is probably allowing new nerve connections to be formed. But, he adds, \"psychological experiences are also creating changes in the brain\".\n\n\"It's not quite as simple as, once this is in your body it's helping to rewire things. There is an interplay with the psychology.\"\n\nBrown, Ron and other researchers who are interested in ibogaine say there's still more research needed on safety and whether the hallucinations are critical to curbing addiction. Its status as an illegal drug, however, makes that difficult.\n\nSo what are the prospects of a hallucinogenic, schedule I substance being approved for medical use in the US?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The heroin-ravaged city fighting back\n\nNot as slim as one might think.\n\nThe FDA just approved Phase III trials for MDMA - the active component in Ecstasy - to study its use in treating post-traumatic stress. Brown believes it is likely to show good results and be approved.\n\nIf it does, he says, that will have an enormous impact on public opinion.\n\nIn the meantime, while the opioid epidemic in the US has slowly raised awareness of ibogaine, Leonard says that as an industry primarily run by former addicts, legitimacy has been a struggle.\n\nTo his dismay, he says Google Ad Words banned ibogaine ads last year. Leonard estimates he lost 60% of his referrals.\n\n\"There is so much stigma around being an addict and so it's hard for people to take us seriously sometimes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, two months after her treatment, Emily is still clean.\n\nJonathan Levinson is a reporter and photographer based in Mexico.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.\n\nThe news comes less than a week before Kim meets the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, for a summit in the demilitarised zone that divides the peninsula.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office welcomed the announcement as \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d towards denuclearisation. \u201cIt will create a very positive environment for the success of the upcoming inter-Korean and North-US summits,\u201d said a statement.\n\nThe move goes some way towards meeting US demands for denuclearisation, as Pyongyang and Washington work towards agreement on when and where Kim will meet Trump for historic talks that barely seemed possible just a few months ago.\n\n\n\nKCNA quoted Kim as saying that North Korea should focus on economic development now that it had achieved its aim of becoming a nuclear state. \u201cThe whole party and the whole nation should now focus on the development of the socialist economy,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThis is the party\u2019s new strategic policy line.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cA fresh climate of detente and peace is being created on the Korean peninsula and the region, and dramatic changes are being made in the international political landscape.\u201d\n\nThe decision to suspend nuclear tests and missile launches came at a plenary meeting of the ruling party\u2019s central committee, which had convened on Friday to discuss a \u201cnew stage\u201d of policies \u2013 prompting speculation that the regime would move towards denuclearisation.\n\n\n\nKim told the meeting that the North\u2019s development of nuclear weapons should be seen as a \u201cgreat victory\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs the weaponisation of nuclear weapons has been verified, it is not necessary for us to conduct any more nuclear tests or test launches of mid- and long-range missiles or ICBMs. The northern nuclear test site has completed its mission,\u201d he added, according to KCNA.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests at Punggye-ri test site in the country\u2019s north-east. It tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, while its last and most powerful test came last September.\n\nNorth Koreans in the dark about Trump summit \u2013 but officials know 'he's crazy' Read more\n\nThose tests, plus a string of missile launches ordered by Kim throughout 2017, at one point appeared to be taking the peninsula to the brink of conflict.\n\nSome analysts greeted the North\u2019s move with caution, noting that the regime had reneged on previous nuclear deals and that Saturday\u2019s announcement did not mention shorter-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Japan and South Korea.\n\nJapan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, cautiously welcomed North Korea\u2019s pledge. \u201cWe welcome it as a forward-looking move \u2026 but an important thing is whether the move will lead to the complete abandonment of missile and nuclear developments in a verifiable and irreversible manner,\u201d Abe said. \u201cWe want to watch it closely.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said he and the US defence secretary, Jim Mattis, had agreed during talks in Washington that any deal must include weapons with which North Korea could continue to threaten its neighbours. \u201cThis is not the time for Japan, the United States and the international community to ease pressure\u201d on North Korea, Onodera said.\n\nJapan\u2019s deputy prime minister and finance minister, Taro Aso, added a note of scepticism. \u201c[North Korea] has made a lot of promises and we paid money on the condition that they will give up [nuclear] experiment sites, but they continued,\u201d Aso said in Washington.\n\nCatherine Dill, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said a promise to end missile and nuclear tests \u201cdoes not equate to the dismantlement of the nuclear and missile programmes\u201d.\n\nDill added: \u201cPerhaps this signals that North Korea is confident enough in its nuclear and missile programmes to concede testing while stringing along the prospect of verifiable dismantlement for years past Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\n\n\u201cVerification is a complex, intricate process that requires much more negotiation and much more trust than is present at the moment. At this point, while I am optimistic, we must remember that North Korea can easily reverse course.\u201d\n\n\n\nScott LaFoy, a Washington-based satellite imagery analyst focusing on ballistic missile and space technologies, said Kim\u2019s comments should be seen as \u201cthe first part of a negotiation.

It also names WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant who communicated with WikiLeaks, which published emails obtained from the hacking of both the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta.\n\nAmong the Russians named as defendants are Aras and Emin Agalarov, a billionaire family referenced as potential conduits between the Trump campaign and Moscow in the explosive email chain involving Trump Jr that preceded the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower. In those emails, Emin Agalarov\u2019s publicist Rob Goldstone informed Trump Jr that the Agalarovs were in possession of \u201chigh level and sensitive information\u201d that they wished to pass on to the Trump campaign as part of \u201cRussia and its government\u2019s support for Mr Trump\u201d.\n\n\n\nRussian interference in the US election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow is the subject of separate inquiries by the FBI and Congress.\n\nThe federal investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, has brought indictments against Manafort, Gates, Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mueller also indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups in February, with violating US law and meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nPapadopoulos and Flynn both pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and have been cooperating. Gates also pleaded guilty to lying to investigators, in addition to financial fraud, and has agreed to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s team. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges that include tax and bank fraud, conspiring against the US, and giving false statements to the FBI.\n\nWhile the White House did not comment on the lawsuit, Trump\u2019s campaign arm called it \u201cfrivolous\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager.\n\n\u201cWith the Democrats\u2019 conspiracy theories against the president\u2019s campaign evaporating as quickly as the failing DNC\u2019s fundraising, they\u2019ve sunk to a new low to raise money, especially among small donors who have abandoned them.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between his campaign and the Russians and referred to the entire notion as a \u201choax\u201d.\n\nThe DNC said the alleged conspiracy \u201cinflicted profound damage\u201d by undermining its ability to disseminate the party\u2019s message to the electorate and sowing divisions with the Democratic party. The lawsuit also states the hacking \u201cseriously compromised the DNC\u2019s internal and external communications\u201d, prompted a significant drop in fundraising, and inflicted damage on the organization\u2019s systems that cost more than $1m to repair.\n\n\u201cNo one is above the law and the perpetrators of this attack must be held accountable,\u201d Perez said. \u201cWe must prevent future attacks on our democracy, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing today.\n\n\u201cThis is not partisan, it\u2019s patriotic \u2026 It is our obligation to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe DNC employed a similar strategy amid the Watergate scandal, filing a civil suit in 1972 seeking damages from Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign in relation to a break-in at the Democratic party\u2019s Washington headquarters. Although Nixon\u2019s attorney general denounced the suit, his campaign settled for $750,000 on the day he left office, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe DNC\u2019s 66-page complaint comes at a time when the president and those in his inner circle are facing mounting legal woes. In addition to Mueller\u2019s inquiry, Trump\u2019s longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is under criminal investigation for business dealings that include hush money paid to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from speaking about an alleged affair with Trump.\n\n\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/eight-convicted-in-italy-over-secret-mafia-negotiations", "published": "2018-04-20T20:59:15", "title": "Eight jailed in Italy over secret talks between state officials and mafia", "text": "Five-year case has thrown light on one of the murkiest chapter\u2019s in Italy\u2019s recent history\n\nEight jailed in Italy over secret talks between state officials and mafia\n\nA court in Italy has convicted eight men, including mob bosses, police investigators and a close associate of Silvio Berlusconi, over a secret attempt to negotiate with the Sicilian mafia in order to end a bloody bombing campaign in the 1990s\n\nAfter the verdict, members of the public cheered the prosecutors.

Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump is a volatile opponent who telegraphed his impatience even before the two men fixed a place to talk, warning he would walk away if he thought the preparations weren\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nBut this unpredictability is the reason there are talks at all. Trump\u2019s barrage of verbal and Twitter attacks on North Koreans \u2013 which have been reported there \u2013 led Pyongyang to question if it was, for the first time in a generation, facing a US president willing to attack them, experts say.\n\nThe bluster of decades of North Korean threats against America was based in no small part on the very real threat the regime poses to the people of Seoul. Millions live in the South Korean capital, which is barely 50km from the de facto border with the north. That it is well within range of artillery and other weapons means the city effectively serves as a human shield for Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme.\n\nOfficials there have long calculated that no US president would risk lives in Seoul with an attack on the North But under Trump that is no longer a safe assumption, says Andrei Lankov, professor of Korean Studies at Kookmin University.\n\n\u201c[North Korea] is facing a pretty unprecedented situation,\u201d said Lankov, the author of Real North Korea. \u201cA US president who appears willing to initiate a strike against them no matter what damage it will do to Seoul, and sanctions seriously affecting their economy.\u201d\n\nIn Pyongyang, the minders who barred questions from western journalists about the summit were frank about Trump himself. \u201cHe is crazy,\u201d said one, referring to Trump\u2019s belligerent speech to the United Nations. \u201c[North Koreans] could not believe it when he actually threatened the annihilation of an entire nation of 25 million people.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Are US defences strong enough to ward off North Korean missiles? Show Hide What kind of anti-missile defences does the US possess? The US has various anti-missile options, some designed to take down missiles at short-range and others for medium-to-long-range. The US relies heavily on the US Patriot missile and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD). The US deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to defend against medium-range missiles. There is a three-phased defence system: ground-based missiles on the Korean peninsula; US naval ships stationed in the Pacific; and two bases in Alaska and California that can launch an estimated 36 interceptors.\n\nIs the US system robust enough to stop a North Korean missile attack? No air defence system offers anything like a complete guarantee of success. The Pentagon offer repeated assurances that air defence systems would be more than a match for any North Korean attack. But when missile defence systems have been put to the test over the last few decades, the performance has been far from reassuring.\n\nThe US provided anti-missile defence systems to Israel and Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War as protection against Iraq's Scud missiles. It was initially claimed that they had shot down 41 of 42 missiles fired by Iraq. But eventually it was acknowledged that only a few missiles had been hit.\n\nRecent tests of interceptors have provided little comfort \u2013 with success rates of around 50% on average. The Pentagon celebrated in May when it destroyed a mock warhead over the Pacific but overall the performance has been spotty. Since the newest intercept system was introduced in 2004 only four of nine intercept attempts have been successful. Of the five tests since 2010, only two have been successful.\n\nAdding to pressure on Kim, international trade vital to the economy has been stifled after China\u2019s unexpected decision to implement harsh sanctions approved by the United Nations.\n\nFor years the Chinese government paid little more than lip service to various tranches of sanctions aimed at reining in the nuclear programme. North Koreans sent seafood, coal and the country\u2019s esoteric range of other legal exports across the border and brought oil, consumer goods and desperately needed hard currency home. But last autumn that changed.\n\nNot all trade has been cut off. China was still buying at least one type of sanctioned iron this spring, the website NK News reported. But from factories forced to ration power, to the silent testimony of idle construction sites, a sudden flood of seafood into the domestic market, and countless other small signs, there is widespread consensus that Beijing has decided to crack down in an unprecedented way.\n\nChina\u2019s motives are opaque; they too may be worried about the prospect of a war on their doorstep given Trump\u2019s belligerence, or share worries about nuclear weapons spreading in a region where they have until now been the only nuclear power.\n\nBut their impact is unquestionable. North Korea is officially committed to self-reliance, and says it can survive controls on trade. In a place where ideology often trumps reality, it is hard to have a frank discussion about the effect of China closing the border.\n\nAt one shoe factory in Pyongyang, the manager strenuously insisted all their raw materials were produced inside North Korea, as workers standing just metres away opened sacks of plastic pellets stamped \u201cmade in China\u201d to feed the production line.\n\nBut the effects have been severe and widespread enough to merit some official reference. \u201cIts true that these sanctions are giving some obstacles to the development of the economy,\u201d said Ri Gi-song, a professor at the Academy of Social Sciences in Pyongyang in a rare interview.\n\nThat was a week after the prime minister, Pak Pong-ju, attacked \u201cvicious sanctions and pressure manoeuvres\u201d, and warned of \u201cunprecedented massive challenges\u201d in an April report to North Korea\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, the website 38 Degrees reported.\n\nThe squeeze from China is likely affecting government coffers, which are bolstered by funds from private enterprise even though there is officially no tax in North Korea.\n\nAnd Kim may be worried that as the economy suffers, austerity may erode support from the small elite who have grown accustomed to the modest luxuries that constitute a high-end lifestyle in North Korea: eating out and drinking in pubs, Karaoke nights, and occasional trip to funfairs and water parks.\n\nKim, like his predecessors, has proved adept at manipulating regional and world powers into providing aid and political support while offering little in return. Now Kim may at last be forced into making real changes to stave off looming political and economic crises.\n\n\u201cThey are going to make concessions in order not to be shot at, and have parts of the sanctions lifted,\u201d Lankov said, suggesting they could include a moratorium on missile and nuclear tests.\n\nBut he believes neither domestic nor international pressure will persuade the government to fully give up its nuclear programme. \u201cThey are not suicidal and if they lose the nuclear weapons, they become extremely vulnerable.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/israeli-forces-kill-two-gaza-frontier-during-fourth-week-protests", "published": "2018-04-20T18:34:14", "title": "Israeli forces kill two at Gaza frontier during fourth week of protests", "text": "Israeli troops stationed on the frontier with Gaza have shot dead two Palestinians and wounded more than 40 people during the fourth week of Friday protests, all of which have been met with lethal force.\n\nThousands of residents from the coastal strip demonstrated near the metal perimeter fence, some burning tyres and throwing rocks.

He had sold all his \u201cclone\u201d plants to other growers, who were using them to cultivate yet more marijuana.\n\n\u201cYou start doing the math on that and it just didn\u2019t make sense how people could be growing that many plants,\u201d Willison said.\n\nFast-forward nearly a year and Oregon does indeed have a glut of marijuana; there are over 1m lb of usable but unsold marijuana, according to the state tracking system.\n\nThat\u2019s more than 128m \u201ceighths\u201d of weed, and almost three times the amount of cannabis sold in Oregon in all of last year.\n\nFlooded with supply, prices are dropping so much that some dispensaries in the Portland area are selling the drug for $4 a gram. That\u2019s less than half the cost of a bargain-basement batch in other US cities where marijuana is legal, like Denver and Seattle.\n\nWhen the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), the agency in charge of cannabis regulation, issued the first licenses to businesses in 2016, projections were for 800 to 1,200 businesses to obtain cannabis licenses in the first couple of years, according to Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the OLCC.\n\nEvery agricultural crop has its highs and its lows. No pun intended\n\nBut 1,824 marijuana-related business licenses have already been issued, including 981 production operations. Another 967 production licenses are in various stages of approval by the state and could come online later this year.\n\nMolly Conroy, the program director for the Oregon Cannabis Association, cautioned that this is a brand new market that needs time to adjust.\n\n\u201cEvery agricultural crop has its highs and its lows,\u201d she said. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d\n\nUnlike Colorado, which also legalized marijuana, many of the cannabis farms in Oregon are outdoors because the plants thrive in the state\u2019s warm, sunny summers. But the first year that recreational cannabis farms were licensed, a rainstorm hammered the crop just before the prime flower harvest in October.\n\n\u201cA lot of crop got destroyed,\u201d said Pettinger. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t salvageable because it had mildew or mold on it. So there was a not a real accurate gauge of what the market looked like.\u201d\n\nDemand remained high \u2013 so, by last fall, hundreds more farms had obtained licenses. And a long, favorable growing season made for a bumper crop. Suddenly, the state had more marijuana than it knew what to do with.\n\nCannabis flowers have a shelf life of several months but after a while, the product gets stale. Andrew Lessar owns Oregon CO2, a company that extracts oils from cannabis flowers, then sells the oils to producers of edibles. Lessar said he gets between five and 10 calls a week from growers who are desperate to generate some income from their flowers.\n\n\u201cIf I see an unknown number on my phone, I know it\u2019s going to be someone saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got 500 lb,\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve got 2,000 lb \u2026 Can you help us?\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Buds at a marijuana dispensary in Portland, Oregon. Photograph: Steve Dipaola/Reuters\n\nBut Lessar said that because of the way cannabis is regulated, he can\u2019t sell the oils back to the producer. They need to already have a buyer lined up or obtain a $5,000 license that covers a different part of the farm-to-consumer process.\n\nAnd because US federal law still prohibits cannabis, Oregon growers cannot legally sell outside the state\u2019s borders.\n\nTristan Reisfar works part-time for a company, High Desert Pure, that produces vapor cartridges and said he fields phone calls from desperate growers offering to sell their marijuana for as little as $100 per lb. When Oregon launched its recreational marijuana program, it was common for growers to count on bringing in $2,400 per lb.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming into another growing season here, what are they going to do then?\u201d Reisfar asked.\n\nReisfar also co-hosts a weekly marijuana-themed talk radio show called The High Desert Co-op. He said he gets calls every week from growers who are looking to sell their cannabis farms and want his promotional help.\n\nMarijuana: is it time to stop using a word with racist roots? Read more\n\nWillison, the co-owner of Eugenius LLC, said he still has \u201ca couple hundred lb of product in our vault\u201d.\n\nHe has pared down his operation from 16 employees to seven. Three-quarters of the farm has been switched from cannabis to hemp seed. Hemp is a related plant that doesn\u2019t offer the same high as cannabis, but has a variety of uses including fabric and medicine. He plans to keep growing marijuana to maintain his brand until the market rebounds. In the meantime, he estimates that the marijuana portion of his business is losing between $5,000 and $10,000 a month.\n\n\u201cThis glut\u2019s going to take a few years. There is really no short-term answer,\u201d Willison said.\n\nSo what\u2019s to come of that 1m lb of weed? Reisfar said that as cannabis flowers age, some of the chemical components that cause a narcotic high break down into slightly different components which instead cause drowsiness.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s another factor in their desperation,\u201d he said of the growers. \u201cThat weed is turning into something that they didn\u2019t start out trying to make: sleepy time weed.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/german-town-braces-for-arrival-of-neo-nazis-music-festival-hitler-birthday-ostritz", "published": "2018-04-20T18:51:19", "title": "German town braces for arrival of neo-Nazis at music festival", "text": "Large police deployment and counter-protests planned for event that coincides with Hitler\u2019s birthday\n\nA small town in eastern Germany is bracing for the arrival of hundreds of neo-Nazis planning to attend a music festival timed to coincide with Adolf Hitler\u2019s birthday.\n\nAnti-fascist groups have promised counter-protests and a large police deployment aims to prevent violence during the Schild und Schwert (Shield and Sword, or SS) festival in Ostritz, Saxony, on the border with Poland, a region where the AfD scored some of its strongest results in the 2017 elections.\n\nThe two-day event is expected to attract up to 1,000 far-right extremists from Germany, the neighboring Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nMany of the mostly male rightwing extremists gathering in the town on Friday wore T-shirts with slogans such as \u201cKeepers of the race\u201d, \u201cWhite is my favourite colour\u201d and \u201cAdolf was the best\u201d.\n\nState rules for the festival stipulates a ban on alcohol, and visitors are prohibited from bringing glass bottles, flagstaffs and certain breeds of dogs.\n\nOrganisers argue that the festival is a political event, granting it legal protection under the German constitution.\n\nIt comes amid a revival of a far-right and ultra-nationalist groups in Germany, with the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) the third largest party in the Bundestag.\n\nThe festival organiser is Thorsten Heise of the far-right fringe party NPD, which is openly xenophobic and antisemitic.

Comey said he wrote the memos because he thought the president might later lie about those interactions.\n\nMystery world leader Trump failed to call for six days revealed to be ... Putin Read more\n\nSeven of the memos, running as long as four pages each, were released on Thursday night on the initiative of Republicans in Congress, who have accused Comey of leaking classified information by causing some of the material to be passed to the press.\n\nAlthough the memos undercut that accusation \u2013 most of them are stamped \u201cunclassified\u201d and others are slightly redacted \u2013 Trump publicized them with an unusual late-night tweet on Thursday claiming that they \u201cshow clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION\u201d.\n\nThose might not be the conclusions that jump out for most readers. Here are six takeaways:\n\nComey\u2019s story is consistent\n\nDescriptions in the memos of key interactions with the president are consistent with descriptions Comey has given elsewhere, including in testimony before Congress and in his new book, A Higher Loyalty.\n\nIn one memo, Comey describes a private dinner in which Trump said \u201cI need loyalty\u201d. In another memo, Comey describes a private meeting in which Trump asked him to \u201clet go\u201d of an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nTrump has flatly denied that either scene took place. \u201cI hardly know the man,\u201d he said of Comey in June 2017, denying he asked for loyalty. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say: \u2018I want you to pledge allegiance.\u2019 Who would do that?\u201d\n\nIn another denial, Trump tweeted in December 2017: \u201cI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\u201d\n\nThe Comey memos, which are clearly contemporaneous accounts written with the even tone and careful eye of a practiced criminal investigator, seem to lend weight to Comey\u2019s version of events, and indicate that it is Trump who is the liar.\n\nTrump returned constantly to the prostitutes story\n\nIn January 2017, it fell to Comey to describe to the president allegations, summarized by former British spy Christopher Steele, that Trump had been with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. In five of the seven Comey memos, Trump discusses the allegations, which included a description of the prostitutes urinating.\n\nHere\u2019s how Comey describes Trump talking about the allegations:\n\n\u201cI said the Russians allegedly had tapes involving him and prostitutes at the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow from about 2013. He interjected: \u2018There were no prostitutes; there were never prostitutes.\u2019 He then said something about him being the kind of guy who didn\u2019t need to \u2018go there\u2019 and laughed (which I understood to be communicating that he didn\u2019t need to pay for sex) \u2026\n\n\u201cAt about this point, he turned to what he called the \u2018golden showers thing\u2019 and recounted much of what he had said previously on that topic \u2026 He said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie. I did not ask any questions. I replied that it was up to him, but that I wouldn\u2019t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued.\n\nComey book likens Trump to a mafia boss 'untethered to truth' Read more\n\n\u201cThe president brought up the \u2018golden showers thing\u2019 and said it really bothered him if his wife had any doubt about it \u2026 The president said \u2018the hookers thing\u2019 is nonsense but that Putin had told him \u2018we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe then went on at great length, explaining that he has nothing to do with Russia \u2026 was not involved with hookers in Russia (Can you imagine me, hookers? I have a beautiful wife, and it has been very painful), is bringing a personal lawsuit against Christopher Steele, always advised people to assume they were being recorded in Russia, has accounts now from those who traveled with him to Miss Universe pageant [sic] that he didn\u2019t do anything, etc.\u201d\n\nTrump wanted to \u2018go after the reporters\u2019\n\nEarly in his administration, Trump was taken aback by the publication of details of phone calls he held with foreign heads of state and other leaks. The president and Comey had multiple bracing calls about the topic, according to the memos, in which Comey wants to go after the leakers and Trump suggests jailing reporters.\n\n\u201cI explained that the FBI gathers intelligence in part to equip the president to make decisions,\u201d Comey writes, \u201cand if people run around telling the press what we do, that ability will be compromised. I said I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message. I said something about it being difficult and he replied that we need to go after the reporters, and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they knew, and it worked. He mentioned Judy Miller by name. I explained that I was a fan of pursuing leaks aggressively but that going after reporters was tricky, for legal reasons and because [Department of Justice] tends to approach it conservatively. He replied by telling me to talk to \u2018Sessions\u2019 and see what we can do about being more aggressive. I told him I would speak to the attorney general \u2026\n\n\u201cThe president then wrapped up our conversation by returning to the issue of finding leakers. I said something about the value of putting a head on a pike as a message. He replied by saying it may involve putting reporters in jail. \u2018They spend a couple days in jail, make a new friend and they are ready to talk.\u2019 I laughed as I walked to the door Reince Priebus had opened.\u201d\n\nThe memos are precise\n\nThe precision of observation in the Comey memos would seem to further bolster the former FBI director\u2019s credibility in the he-said, he-said war with Trump. Of his private dinner with Trump in the White House Green room, Comey writes: \u201cThe conversation, which was pleasant at all times, was chaotic, with topics touched, left, then returned to later, making it very difficult to recount in a linear fashion \u2026\n\n\u201cAt various times, he talked about the inauguration and crowd size, the campaign and his effective use of free media (\u2018earned media\u2019), the extraordinary luxury of the White House (which he compared favorably to Mar-a-Lago), his many activities during the day and week, his young son\u2019s height, the viciousness of the campaign (where I interjected about Adams and Jefferson; he said he had been given a book about it, which was upstairs), how he had not been mocking a handicapped reporter, had not assaulted any of the women who claimed he did (reviewing in detail several of the allegations), and many other things.\n\nTrump questioned Flynn\u2019s judgment\n\nIn a 28 January 2017 memo describing his private dinner with the president, Comey writes that Trump had deep reservations about the judgment of his national security adviser, whom Trump would remove two weeks later.\n\n\u201cHe then went on to explain that he has serious reservations about Mike Flynn\u2019s judgment and illustrated with a story from that day,\u201d Comey writes. In the story, Trump tells British prime minister Theresa May that she had been the first foreign leader to call him after his inauguration, when Flynn interrupted to say that actually a different foreign leader, whose name is redacted from the memo, had called prior to May.\u201d\n\nDemocratic party sues Russia, Trump campaign for allegedly disrupting 2016 election Read more\n\nTrump then \u201cconfronted\u201d Flynn and grew \u201cheated\u201d that he did not know about the earlier call, Comey writes, concluding: \u201cIn telling the story, the president pointed his fingers at his head and said: \u2018The guy has serious judgment issues.\u2019\u201d\n\nLater, chief of staff Reince Priebus, whom the Trump administration offered as Comey\u2019s White House liaison, asks Comey if Flynn was under surveillance. Comey replied that the direct question was not appropriate but then answered the question. The answer he gave was redacted.\n\nTrump had mastery of the details\n\nThe president has often appeared indifferent to or incapable of mastering the details of policy. (On healthcare: \u201cNobody knew healthcare could be this complicated\u201d; on North Korea: \u201cAfter listening [to China\u2019s Xi Jinping] for 10 minutes, I realized it\u2019s not so easy.\u201d)\n\nBut Comey, who has told interviewers he thinks Trump is of \u201cabove average intelligence\u201d, describes a deep understanding on the part of the president of how he, Comey, had thrice taken the public stage during the election.\n\n\u201cHe knew the sequence of events extremely well, breaking them down in his lexicon into Comey One, Comey Two and Comey Three developments, and he walked through how he saw each played out during the campaign, in great detail.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/eta-apologises-basque-separatists-deadly-violence", "published": "2018-04-20T09:23:48", "title": "'We are truly sorry': Eta apologises for four decades of deadly violence", "text": "Basque separatist group bears \u2018direct responsibility\u2019 for deaths of at least 800 people in name of nationhood struggle\n\n'We are truly sorry': Eta apologises for four decades of deadly violence\n\nThe Basque terrorist group Eta, which killed more than 800 people during its four-decade armed campaign, has apologised for the suffering it caused and asked for the forgiveness of victims and their families as it prepares to dissolve.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday morning, the group made a full and unambiguous apology for its actions, accepting that it bore \u201cdirect responsibility\u201d for years of bloodshed and misery.\n\n\u201cWe know that we caused a lot of pain during that long period of armed struggle, including damage that can never be put right,\u201d it said. \u201cWe wish to show our respect for those who were killed or wounded by Eta and those who were affected by the conflict.

Hofmann had been researching the ergot fungus, hoping to develop a drug to treat fatigue. Among the compounds he was analysing was lysergic acid \u2013 Lysergs\u00e4ure-Diethylamid in German, also known as LSD. On Friday 16 April 1943, Hofmann left the lab feeling a little dizzy: \u201cI lay down and had these wonderful dreams \u2013 I saw every thought as an image,\u201d he said in an interview for his 100th birthday. The chemist concluded that he had accidentally touched the substance, and was intrigued by its powerful effect.\n\nThree days later, on 19 April, he returned to the lab and swallowed a tiny amount just to see what would happen: \u201cAs it later turned out, it was five times too much and gave me a horror trip.\u201d He asked an assistant to take him home by bicycle, and Basel transformed into a panorama of hellish and heavenly visions. The bike seemed to freeze to the spot; a friendly neighbour turned into an evil witch. Hours later, Hofmann felt wonderful. \u201cLSD called me, I didn\u2019t seek it out,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt came to me.\u201d\n\nLoving LSD\n\nToday, Basel wears its psychedelic history with pride. Locals point out that the city has for centuries served as a safe haven for rebels and free thinkers. An exhibition at Basel\u2019s Kunstmuseum celebrates Hofmann\u2019s discovery in the context of the city\u2019s creative history, pairing it with nightmarish, horror trip-like prints by Old Masters such as Bruegel. Thousands of visitors are expected to flock to Basel to celebrate \u201cBicycle Day\u201d, as 19 April is known among the cognoscenti. And researchers are studying LSD\u2019s medical properties again, shrugging off decades of stigma.\n\nKunstmuseum Basel (@kunstmuseumbs) Don't know what our current #exhibition #BaselShortStories is about? Here comes the answer: https://t.co/adHnbH6Qbo\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s relatively permissive regulations around researching LSD have helped the renewed effort to understand its medical potential. New methods, including advanced brain scanners, also give unprecedented insights into its effects. One study by the Swiss psychiatrist Peter Gasser has recently shown that LSD can be used to reduce a sense of existential fear. Its capacity to induce feelings of deep bliss raise the prospect of therapeutic uses, for example to treat depression.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in 1943, holding a model of the LSD molecule.

In general the chemicals and pharma business has shaped urban life in Basel, most recently through the Novartis Campus, a $2.3bn research and development centre in the St Johann neighbourhood, with a centrepiece designed by Frank Gehry. The campus has attracted global talent, but some locals warn that an influx of wealthy newcomers is pushing up prices and crowding out poorer locals. \u201cFrom working-class area to hip chemistry-corner,\u201d wrote local journalist Andreas Schwald about the rapidly changing neighbourhood last year. He points out that while the area offers a bustling, interesting mix of students and expats, cheap housing for poorer families is under threat. Overall, rents in Basel have risen 15% over the past decade, pushing up the general cost of living \u2013 which is rising faster than anywhere else in Switzerland.\n\nBasel in numbers\n\n250 micrograms \u2013 the amount of LSD Hofmann ingested before his bike trip\n\n200 micrograms \u2013 the amount of LSD participants take in the study at University Hospital Basel\n\n19 - percentage of Baselers who \u201cregularly ride bikes\u201d, according to a survey.

Its reputation as an innovation hub began in 1460, with the founding of Basel University, Switzerland\u2019s oldest, which in 1661 acquired the world\u2019s first public art collection \u2013 setting Basel\u2019s other big theme, fine art. During the Reformation, silk dyers arrived, laying the foundation for Basel\u2019s pharmaceutical and chemicals companies. In 1897, Basel hosted the First Zionist Congress under Theodor Herzl. In 1996, Sandoz \u2013 in whose labs Hofmann discovered LSD \u2013 and its rival Ciba merged to create the chemicals giant Novartis.\n\nBasel in sound ...\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Countless musicians and pop classics have been inspired by Hofmann\u2019s discovery. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\n\nMusically speaking, Basel\u2019s most important contribution to pop culture may indeed be LSD. Countless songs have been inspired by Hofmann\u2019s discovery at the Sandoz lab, and it\u2019s hard to think of a chemical compound with a broader and deeper musical influence. \u201cWell I met a girl called Sandoz, and she taught me many, many things ...\u201d sang the Animals. Even in current LSD studies, psychedelic music is played to the participants. On the other hand, John Lennon tried hard to dispel the rumour that the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds was a nod to the substance and its acronym.\n\n... and vision\n\nNZZ Wissenschaft (@NZZWissen) LSD kann Kranken die Angst vor dem Tod nehmen.

But locals say there\u2019s much more to Basel\u2019s art scene than record prices. The city\u2019s free-thinking legacy has inspired a robust counter-cultural tradition \u2013 with or without the help of mind-altering substances.\n\nSebastien Pierre Portron, an art consultant, grew up here and returned to the city three years ago after some time abroad. \u201cPeople from all over Europe have been coming here for centuries,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just artists but different people from all cultures, all religions. In the arts, people came to Basel from very early on. Holbein the Elder and the Younger came here to develop and promote their art, and many others followed \u2013 Picasso, and more recently, even Ai Wei Wei.\u201d\n\nPortron works for Artst\u00fcbli, a gallery set up by a local curator, Philipp Brogli, that promotes urban art. The gallery works with newcomers as well as more established urban artists. Among them is the French artist Invader, famous for his \u201cspace invader\u201d mosaics in public spaces \u2013 of which there are 24 in Basel alone.\n\nGen Atem, a Swiss urban artist based in New York and Zurich, remembers being one of the first contributors to Basel\u2019s budding graffiti scene in the 1980s. \u201cI used to take the train from Zurich to Paris or Amsterdam, because at the time, a lot of good sprayers were there,\u201d he said. \u201cMy train passed Basel, and I looked out of the window and noticed that all the walls there were still empty. And that\u2019s how it started.\u201d\n\nHe says now the urban art scene in Basel has overtaken that of Zurich, its longtime rival. Basel\u2019s location helps \u2013 it sits between Switzerland, Germany and France, attracting artists from all over. And Art Basel is pulling in more and more graffiti artists as the boundary between commercial and street art increasingly dissolves.\n\nWhat\u2019s on for Bicycle Day?\n\nKunstmuseum Basel (@kunstmuseumbs) Wow!

Basel Art Center offers a special LSD night as part of its psychedelic retrospective of HR Giger, the Swiss artist known for his terrifying designs for Alien, the movie. Basel Short Stories, an exhibition at the Kunstmuseum, honours Hofmann as well as other Basel luminaries such as Erasmus and the feminist Iris von Roten. And, more prosaically, there are the many cycling routes in and around the city.\n\nWhat\u2019s everyone talking about?\n\nGentrification. \u201cIn Switzerland\u2019s cities, entire neighbourhoods are changing: first they are cheap and attractive, then the new residents bring in more money, and in the end the existing population can hardly afford the rising rents,\u201d wrote journalist Benjamin von Wyl. He sees Basel as a particularly striking example: the supply of available flats has shrunk by two-thirds since 2005.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Frank Gehry-designed building at the heart of the Novartis Campus.

According to Von Wyl, a spokesperson for the Baseler canton said the new community would not become an \u201curban monoculture for the better off\u201d \u2013 without revealing concrete steps for preventing this from happening.\n\nRotterdam in the spotlight: from dismal mega-port to 'Dutch Brooklyn' Read more\n\nCloser zoom\n\nLocal papers Basler Zeitung and bz Basel, and Zurich\u2019s Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung have run several in-depth features and interviews on the anniversary. In LSD, My Problem Child, Hofmann writes about his life, his discovery of LSD and his research into sacred plants. He warns against \u201cmistaking this substance for a pleasure drug\u201d. But with the right spiritual preparation and under the right medical conditions, he argues, his \u201cproblem child could become a wonder child.\u201d\n\nDo you live in Basel?

On the south side of the palm-lined road, on a spring lunchtime, the Fattoush restaurant is packed with customers chatting noisily in Arabic and Hebrew over Levantine and fusion salads, cardamom-flavoured coffee and exquisite Palestinian knafeh desserts.\n\n\n\nFashionable eateries like Fattoush are one reason why Israel\u2019s third largest city and its biggest \u201cmixed\u201d one, as officially classified, is held up as a model of Jewish-Arab coexistence. Not everyone agrees with the concept, of course, and the \u201cc\u201d word is often qualified, placed in inverted commas, or simply dismissed as propaganda. Official figures say Arabs make up 14% of Haifa\u2019s 280,000-strong population; unofficial estimates are closer to 18%, swelled by students and commuters from nearby Galilee. Public spaces, at least, are open to all. And the ever-present Israeli-Palestinian conflict is, usually, softer-edged than elsewhere in the country.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you that all Jews love Arabs and vice versa, but people do feel safe here Yona Yahav, mayor of Haifa\n\n\u201cI prefer to talk of shared existence rather than coexistence,\u201d says Yona Yahav, the veteran Jewish mayor. \u201cHaifa\u2019s Jews and Arabs are the same Jews and Arabs as in Jerusalem, but here things work in a stable way.\u201d\n\nYahav\u2019s office is lined with portraits of his predecessors, the first two wearing Ottoman tarbooshes. The street outside bears the name of one of them, Hassan Bey Shukri. Yahav flourishes a copy of a Hebrew newspaper notice mourning Shukri\u2019s death in 1940. \u201cI can promise you that this won\u2019t happen if I die,\u201d he jokes. He is also keen to point out that his secretary, Reem, is an Arab. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that all Jews love Arabs and vice versa, but people do feel safe here.\u201d\n\nNo one questions that the city is special. \u201cIf all of Israel and Palestine could be like Haifa, I\u2019d be happy,\u201d muses Amjad Iraqi, a twentysomething Palestinian intellectual. \u201cIt\u2019s not lovey-dovey.

But it is not an island.\u201d\n\nThe local HQ of Odeh\u2019s party, the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, is on Ben-Gurion Boulevard opposite Fattoush. It is ironic that the street is named after David Ben-Gurion, the Jewish state\u2019s founder and first prime minister. But there are many similar examples: the Istiqlal (\u201cIndependence\u201d) mosque is at the junction of Shavei Zion (\u201cReturnees to Zion\u201d) and Kibbutz Galuyot (\u201cthe Ingathering of the Exiles\u201d) streets.

In the twilight years of the Ottoman empire it was the terminus for a branch line of the Damascus-Hejaz railway. Allenby Street is named for the British general who freed the town in 1918, soon after the Balfour declaration backed the establishment of a \u201cJewish national home\u201d in Palestine. The port opened in 1933, followed by an oil pipeline starting in Iraq. At that time, explains historian Motti Golani, half the Jewish population spoke Arabic. During the second world war, when Italian aircraft bombed the city, Jews and Arabs huddled together in basements.\n\nBy 1948, the population was 70,000 Jews and 65,000 Arabs. But war changed that. In April, as fighting raged and the British prepared to leave, all but 3,000 Arabs were expelled or fled to Lebanon or the West Bank. The history of that fateful year remains bitterly contested: the Jewish mayor \u2013 unaware of military planning \u2013 urged Arab leaders to stay but they felt unable to comply with the terms for a truce. Newly arrived Jewish immigrants moved into abandoned homes in Wadi Salib. Many houses, defined as \u201cabsentee property\u201d, are now in a state of advanced decline. The city\u2019s flea market is held in the shadow of a crumbling Turkish bathhouse, Hammam al-Pasha. Impressive new glass and steel towers, housing the city\u2019s courts, loom over the ruins.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arab refugees from Haifa disembarking at Port Said, Egypt in 1948. Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images\n\nHaifa occupies an important place in Palestinian collective memory thanks to local luminaries such as Emile Habibi and Toufik Toubi. Habibi wrote the best-known novel by a Palestinian in Israel: The Secret Life of Saeed: The Pessoptimist. Etched on his grave are the words: \u201cI remain in Haifa.\u201d Acre-born Ghassan Kanafani, assassinated by the Mossad, captured the essence of the conflict in his novella Return to Haifa, in which a visiting Palestinian refugee encounters an Israeli woman who survived Auschwitz. Palmer Gate, the entrance to the port, is where Holocaust survivors came ashore and terrified Palestinians fled by boat to Acre or Beirut, mostly never to return.\n\n\u2018Coexistence is not equality\u2019\n\nEmile\u2019s shawarma restaurant \u2013 Haifa\u2019s legendary best \u2013 is always crowded. Abu Shaker, near the port, serves superb hummus. Both are no-frills Arab-run establishments with large Hebrew signs outside and a majority of Jewish customers. But the city\u2019s reputation for inter-communal harmony can be illustrated by even more impressive \u2013 if non-culinary \u2013 achievements: 32% of the doctors at the Rambam hospital are Arabs. Arabic is heard in Haifa\u2019s shops and on its streets and buses in a way that it rarely is in West Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. The offices and clinics of Arab lawyers and dentists line the streets of overwhelmingly Jewish and upmarket residential areas. In other \u201cmixed\u201d Israeli cities like Jaffa, Ramle and Lod, Arabs are poorer and less socially mobile.\n\nHadar HaCarmel, up the hill from Wadi Salib, is Haifa\u2019s most diverse neighbourhood. In its western quarter, 60% of the population is Arab. On Masada Street, a hipster cafe culture has blurred ethnic differences that are normally easy to spot. \u201cCoexistence!\u201d shrugs Arik, a Jewish antiques dealer. \u201cIn Haifa there\u2019s no choice.\u201d Yossi, who runs a nearby record shop, lives in Kababir; Walid, an Arab architect, in the largely Jewish area of Merkaz HaCarmel.\n\nCo-existence is not equality. Speaking the same language and eating hummus together doesn\u2019t mean Jews and Arabs are equal Tom Mehager, Adalah\n\nHaifa\u2019s tolerance is tested at regular intervals. In October 2000, at the start of the second intifada, 13 Arab citizens were shot dead by police while demonstrating in solidarity with their kinfolk in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Yahav\u2019s predecessor ensured the city remained calm. It was harder three years later when a woman suicide bomber from Jenin blew herself up and killed 21 others in Maxim\u2019s restaurant \u2013 jointly owned by Jews and Arabs. In the Lebanon war of 2006, a missile fired by Hezbollah killed two elderly Arabs. Successive Israeli wars against Hamas in Gaza \u2013 in 2008-9, 2012 and again in 2014 \u2013 saw anger flare. \u201cIn Haifa, Arabs and Jews live alongside each other, but when there is tension they move apart,\u201d argues Amjad Shbita of Sikkuy, the Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality. \u201cHaifa\u2019s coexistence is the best in Israel, but it can still be easily damaged.\u201d\n\nPalestinians in Haifa and across Israel have grown closer to relatives and friends beyond the pre-1967 \u201cgreen line\u201d border with the West Bank, but their lives are very different and they have their own issues close to home. In 2013, protests erupted over a government plan to demolish the homes of\u201cunrecognised\u201d Bedouin communities in the Negev and build a Jewish town. Two years ago, after an unusually hot autumn, fires consumed large areas of the Carmel, triggering accusations by rightwing Jewish politicians of an \u201carson intifada\u201d \u2013 though no one was ever charged.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Palestinian refugee stands next to graffiti depicting assassinated Palestinian writer Ghassan Kanafani. Photograph: Nasser Nasser/AP\n\nHaifa-based NGOs have their work cut out tackling discrimination in social services and budget allocations. The worst poverty is in Halissa, a mainly Arab neighbourhood where violence is blamed on rivalry between Bedouin clans and relocated collaborators from the West Bank. \u201cThe Israeli idea of coexistence is about a majority and a minority \u2013 the strong and the weak,\u201d observes Tom Mehager of Adalah (Justice), which is devoted to securing the rights of Israel\u2019s Arab citizens \u2013 and has vocally condemned the army\u2019s killing of Palestinians in Gaza. \u201cCoexistence is not equality. Speaking the same language and eating hummus together doesn\u2019t mean Jews and Arabs are equal.\u201d Jafar Farah, who runs the Mossawa (Equality) centre, compares the relationship between the two peoples to one between \u201ca rider and a horse\u201d. And that, he insists, \u201cis how Yona Yahav deals with the Arab community in Haifa.\u201d\n\n\u2018In Haifa it\u2019s not hate, but not love either\u2019\n\nEducation provides important insights. In Haifa, as elsewhere, Jewish and Arab children mostly attend separate schools. Many Arab children (the majority are Christians), study in fee-paying church schools, and a few dozen in Jewish ones. There are no Jews in Arab public schools, where standards are poor. The curricula are different too. \u201cPeople want to stay within their own communities to speak in their native languages, have days off on their own holidays, and learn about their own history, culture and religion,\u201d says Asaf Ron. \u201cAssimilation through attending the other community\u2019s schools is a free choice that almost no one chooses.\u201d\n\nThe whole country is based one separation in a very profound way Merav Ben-Nun, Yad beyad\n\nThe Yad beyad (\u201cHand in Hand\u201d) private network of bilingual schools complains about long waiting lists and a struggle to secure municipal support. In its kindergarten in Hadar, Arab and Jewish six-year-olds sing songs and are captivated by nursery rhymes that interchange Hebrew and Arabic \u2013 a heartwarming but highly unusual sight. \u201cThe whole country is based on separation in a very profound way,\u201d says Merav Ben-Nun, its community organiser.\n\nHigher education is a different story. Haifa University is 40% Arab, and the Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology, 23%, though Arab graduates are unlikely to find jobs in security-related industries. Arab students are younger than Jewish ones, who mostly spend up to three years from the age of 18 doing the compulsory military service from which the vast majority of Arabs are exempt. \u201cArab and Jewish students sit in the same classes but barely speak to each other,\u201d notes Golani. National holidays \u2013 Holocaust Day, Memorial Day and Independence Day \u2013 feel especially awkward on campus.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The annual \u2018Festival of Festivals\u2019 marks Hanukah, Christmas and Eid al-Adha. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\n\nIndependence Day is celebrated in Haifa with concerts, folk-dancing and firework displays, but the highly polished jewel in the crown of the city\u2019s coexistence narrative is the annual \u201cFestival of Festivals\u201d, held in December to mark Hanukah, Christmas and the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Tens of thousands of Jewish visitors throng the narrow streets of Wadi Nisnas, marvelling at the feeling that they have gone abroad for the weekend. Yahav is especially keen to promote the month-long event.\n\nOlder Palestinians tend to be relaxed about this, but younger activists can be contemptuous about condescension or racism towards \u201ccolourful\u201d natives. Many are keen to assert their growing self-confidence in the face of what they condemn as Israeli \u201capartheid and settler colonialism\u201d \u2013 in the words of a strategy paper that was drawn up in the cafe Fattoush last December.\n\n'This land is just dirt': a rooftop view of Jerusalem Read more\n\nThe closure of Haifa\u2019s Arab theatre, al-Midan (\u201cThe Square\u201d), is cited as an example: state funding was withdrawn after it staged a play about a Palestinian security prisoner. The defiant response was to create an autonomous crowdfunded alternative \u2013 al-Khashabi (\u201cThe Stage\u201d). Its Arabic-language performances are translated into English, but conspicuously not into Hebrew. \u201cIndependent Palestinian institutions do not believe in coexistence,\u201d explains Al-Khashabi\u2019s director, Bashar Murkus. \u201cWe believe in dialogue from a position of strength and independence.\u201d His colleague Khoulood Tannous flatly refuses even to use the \u201cc\u201d word. \u201cNo one is shelling us here,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s no Gaza, nor the West Bank. It\u2019s mind games.\u201d\n\nPolitician Ayman Odeh\u2019s disapproving view is that influence should matter more than identity to Israel\u2019s Palestinian minority, in Haifa and beyond, and that joint struggle is the key to a more equal future. \u201cArabs are developing autonomy at the expense of Arab-Jewish cooperation,\u201d warns Sikkuy\u2019s Shbita. Neither side harbours illusions about the other. \u201cIn Haifa it\u2019s not hate, but there\u2019s not too much love either,\u201d is the stark conclusion of Omer Shaffer, a Jewish Technion postgraduate who was both moved and surprised when an Arab colleague told him to \u201ctake care\u201d when he went off to do a stint of reserve army duty at a checkpoint in the West Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty indifferent. We\u2019ve found a way to ignore each other without killing each other.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/13/australian-cities-on-instagram-surf-sand-sydney-melbourne-perth-adelaide-brisbane-canberra", "published": "2018-04-13T10:30:04", "title": "Surf, sand and sunset skylines: Australian cities on Instagram", "text": "Perth, Darwin, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart, Canberra and Sydney have Instagram presences as distinct as their characters\n\nSurf, sand and sunset skylines: Australian cities on Instagram\n\nAustralia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with a full 40% of its population living in either Melbourne or Sydney: large, sprawling, coastal cities with very different personalities.

Photograph: Alamy\n\nI moved to the Gold Coast just over 10 years ago. Having spent most of my life living in English cities, I was taken aback by its newness and the stunning location. As the father of two teenaged boys, I came to look at the city as one going through its adolescent stage of development. Struggling with the growing pains of rapid urbanisation, not sure of its identity, prone to hubris and with a somewhat ambiguous attitude to sex and sexuality, the city could not be described as mature. But it was only around 50 years old \u2013 in city years, pretty young.\n\nThere have lately been clear signs that the city is growing up. It\u2019s begun to think more seriously about its long-term future and to develop a persona beyond being famous for fun, laying the foundations for economic growth and cultural capital. To go from a collection of beachside villages to the sixth-largest city in the country has been a bit like the rollercoaster rides you can experience at our theme parks \u2013 but maybe now we\u2019re shrieking a little bit less as we go. So long as the city can retain its youthful exuberance, its newfound maturity promises an exciting future. Prof Paul Burton, director of the Cities Research Institute at Griffith University\n\nCanberra: already a 30-minute city\n\nCanberra is something of an anomaly in Australia \u2013 a city which has been planned, almost down to each acre block, with large median strips for light rail and suburbs that fit in with the geographical landscape. If this good planning continues, Canberra will remain a 30-minute city for a long time to come. Jason Vettig, Canberra\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t need to leave Brisbane to find home\u2019\n\nBrisbane has always been a place that I longed to escape from. The big cities of Melbourne and Sydney called me with (partially imagined) tantalising opportunities to remake myself and embrace a more vivid, cultured life. In my mid-20s, my shorthand for this was describing Melbourne as the European Australia and Sydney the London Australia. And yet five years later, nudging 30, I\u2019m settled in Brisbane with a husband and a mortgage. The coffee here is better than Melbourne, and young people can live in a house bigger than a shoebox for a fraction of Sydney prices.\n\nBrisbane is also growing in advocacy movements, the recent gay marriage rallies symbolising the final shaking off of the \u201cJohburg\u201d-era backwater town. Standing in a large happy crowd with a lei around my neck I realised that I didn\u2019t need to leave to find home. Stewardship for the environment is also prioritised. I now light a candle that, as Brisbane grows, the focus will be on people and not profits: the ongoing fight for all Australian cities. Bethany Masters, Brisbane\n\n\u2018Perth: one huge, puzzling opportunity\u2019\n\nPerth is strung out along the coast, and feels like it has no depth. Its centre is dead while its inner suburbs are vibrant. It is the perfect climate to walk and cycle, but few bother. It has a limited but effective public transport system, but people try to avoid it. It has endless stretches of pristine beaches, with nobody on them. I find Perth one huge, puzzling opportunity. Phil Wilkinson, Perth\n\n\u2018Overpopulation is eating away at the quality of life in Melbourne\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artwork in Fitzroy, Melbourne built from abandoned oBike scheme bikes. Photograph: Michael Dodge/Getty Images\n\nMelbourne is a beautiful city, full of parks, open remnant bush, bay beaches. However, we are losing this environment as overpopulation eats away at the quality of life. Smog is noticeably worse than it was 10 years ago \u2013 I could taste the air today. There is less and less open space, as developers cram units on to spaces that used to hold only one dwelling. In my street, eight units were built on one block. The natural environment is disappearing \u2013 street trees die because their roots can\u2019t get water \u2013 and the ground is covered in concrete. We all suffer: newcomers and those who have lived here for decades.\n\nImmigration is generally a good thing for communities. However, untrammelled growth is not. We are currently governed by those who think only of short-term outcomes and not long-term consequences. The question has to be \u201cHow much immigration is sustainable for Australia?\u201d and how should that be managed. Janet McColl, Melbourne\n\n\u2018I\u2019m alarmed by the denial of our climate future\u2019\n\nBen Harris-Roxas (@ben_hr) Excellent longer piece by @DeliaFalconer on the GSC\u2019s three cities plan for Sydney, for @guardiancities https://t.co/xSgGcPXgI1\n\nBen Harris-Roxas (@ben_hr) The best aspects are that it casts doubt on specious claims about three historical Aboriginal regions across Greater Sydney, and that there\u2019s no allowance for climate change in the plans.\n\nBen Harris-Roxas (@ben_hr) I\u2019m alarmed about the denial of our climate future in the plan. Western Sydney is often the hottest place in Australia, and on occasion the world. Removing green space for housing and a huge concrete airport is not climate adaptation - it\u2019s thermal misery.\n\nBen Harris-Roxas (@ben_hr) Further, there are no historical antecedents for successfully building even a small city focused on an airport. The aerotropolis is a planning fiction so fanciful that a multi-function polis is a sound and sensible notion in comparison.\n\nHobart is more than Mona\n\nAs a young person under 30 living in Hobart, I love my lifestyle \u2013 the access to the outdoors and the scenery are fantastic. But lately it feels more and more like we are just props in a tourist show. Even your article for Hobart is about the Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) and how it pushes boundaries. Mona has put Hobart on the map, but it has also made it unliveable for so many of us by sparking a tourism boom that has exploded house prices and diverted rental housing to Airbnb.\n\nI hope that Hobart, and Tasmania, can manage the ever increasing numbers of tourists who want to come and see the beautiful place we live in. But looking at other cities in Australia, Melbourne and Sydney in particular, I\u2019m not confident that it will be done well. I think that a few people will make a lot of money and the rest of us will continue to be props in cruiseship holiday snaps. Anonymous, Hobart\n\n\u2018The conservative brigade is ripping the soul out of this country\u2019\n\nAdelaide works hard for its wealth\n\nAdelaide is on the edge of human habitability and economic sustainability, a precarious position that has inspired generations to cultivate an innovative, fun and beautiful city. Without the relentless growth of the east coast and the buried treasure of the west, Adelaide\u2019s politicians and entrepreneurs have had to drive its prosperity \u2013 from the great landed families of the late-19th/early-20th century through to the modernisation under the recently departed Jay Weatherill government.\n\nAdelaide works hard for its wealth, whether that is appropriating federal government ministries and funds or baiting private capital. We always appear to teeter on the edge of economic oblivion \u2013 a great if stressful motivator for the city and its people. With the economic and environmental sword of Damocles perpetually hovering over our collective heads \u2013 see the current state of the Murray river, and millennial drought \u2013 we get on with it and make sure that our city stays the most liveable and beautifully constructed city in Australia. James Johnson, Adelaide\n\nIndigenous people are still disadvantaged in Australian cities\n\nThe same displacement of Indigenous people by gentrification written about by Jack Latimore happened in Perth. Fifty years ago, East Perth had many Noongar households. Now they are not there, except on the street experiencing homelessness. Perth was declared a prohibited zone for Indigenous people in the 1920s; they needed a pass to go in to work in the city and if they had not left by 6pm they could be jailed. The area along the river in East Perth, where the rents were cheaper and there was unskilled work, became a refuge. Restrictions on the movement of Aboriginal people were lifted after 1954, but East Perth retained an Indigenous community of between 175 and 200 people throughout the 1960s, like a reserve in the city. The state did nothing to help them out of poverty or provide accommodation. A newspaper editorial blamed unaffordable rent and a shortage of housing: \u201cWe would like to think there is no poverty, and there are no underprivileged or disadvantaged people in this wonderful state, but this is not so. \u2026 Until the State Housing Commission build four-bedroomed houses and cut down the waiting list, there will continue to be disadvantaged people of this type.\u201d Not dissimilar to issues being raised in Perth 50 years later. Stephen Hall, Shelter WA, Perth\n\nAustralia\u2019s smaller cities are doomed to repeat its largest\u2019s mistakes\n\nNewcastle [160km (100mi) north-east of Sydney] is currently experiencing the process of growth and gentrification that I experienced in Sydney five years ago. Australia\u2019s small cities provide an opportunity to do something different, yet, because of state control, we are forced to trundle down a path that has already proven a mistake. I fear Newcastle will end up in the same mess as Sydney. What I hope for is a different model \u2013 either as a regional centre, or as a regional outpost of Sydney supported by fast rail. Jenepher Surbey, Newcastle\n\nSuburban Brisbane made me long for a latte\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New home construction in Mango Hill, north Brisbane. Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP\n\nWe moved to Brisbane in 1986 from Norwich when I was eight and I lived there for the next 19 years. I\u2019ve always considered it \u201cwhere I grew up\u201d. My memories of childhood are of houses with big gardens, and I spent most of my time outdoors riding bikes, playing ball games, getting around barefoot. We didn\u2019t lock the windows at night, and usually left the front door open. My parents bought a house in Norman Park, a quiet, typical suburb, for $60k in the late 80s. They sold it for $130k in the late 90s. It\u2019s now worth around $850k.\n\nI visited Brisbane a year ago and was reminded how beautiful, green, friendly and relaxed it still is. But this development of the inner city and suburbs has priced people out. My friends who still live there have bought big houses and gardens in the sprawling deep south and western suburbs, but there is no culture around them. No cafes. No art galleries. No bars. The city, its river, the music and the pulse of Brisbane are so distant they may as well be another city altogether. It\u2019s flat, endless suburbia. I spent a weekend there and became so affected by ennui I had to mainline a latte. Brand King, Chilmark, UK\n\nMelbourne is fading away into a bland haze\n\nLow-density Canberra is \u2018deathly dull\u2019 \u2013 even depressing\n\nCanberra is less a city than a series of low-density suburbs, with a population of 400,000 spread out over huge distances. This means that it\u2019s extremely car dependent and decentralised, which makes it hard for culture to survive. The NewActon development was sold as a cultural precinct, but within a few months of people moving into apartments, noise complaints chased the \u201cculture\u201d away. Thus another part of the city was returned to being an eerie ghost town. The outdoor, pedestrianised City Walk should be lined with stalls, street food, music and buskers, but it is just completely empty \u2013 if you drop a pin, you can hear the echo.\n\nThe CBD is deathly dull. Nobody walks in Canberra because of the large distances between everything and, let\u2019s be real, it has no real interesting architecture or environment. I\u2019ve often been told by people who move here: \u201cIn Melbourne, I walked 10km a day; in Canberra, I drive 500m to go to the corner store.\u201d You don\u2019t see people doing anything outside. There is no life. This actually can make for quite a depressing atmosphere. Canberra could be a great city, but it needs to dump its extremely restrictive zoning and its nimby attitude, and embrace a complete urban rethink. Kaoru Azuma, Canberra\n\nIf you\u2019re not a family person, Perth isn\u2019t for you\n\nPerth is a weird city: the capital of Western Australia, but low density, with a huge urban sprawl. The only reasons people stay here are family ties, the remoteness of Perth and a lack of nearby opportunities. Perth seems to be built around keeping rich, conservative families happy with their lot and little else. If you\u2019re not a family person, there\u2019s very little culture for you to connect with.\n\nThe lack of culture has always been a real problem for me. When I get an interest in something, in general I find that in Perth no one cares, or a tiny niche group does, but it\u2019s a bit too insular for new members. This ranges from politics to arts to video games. I do worry that this city is doomed to be little more than a big town, due to overinvestment in tourist attractions, like Colin Barnett\u2019s Elizabeth Quay, instead of the people that live here all year.

The lab is located below a methadone clinic.\n\n\u201cWe see the effects of drug addiction and mental illness every single day,\u201d said Arvind Gupta, the founder of IndieBio, an incubator which has invested $250,000 in seed funding and lab space for Neurocarrus because he believes the co-founders might offer a partial solution to a national crisis.\n\nOpioids prescribed less in states where medical marijuana legal, studies find Read more\n\nOver the past seven years, Blum and Pavlik have been developing a drug designed to treat the kind of severe and chronic pain frequently treated with opioids. But their drug is missing something \u2013 the high.\n\n\u201cI think what our drug could do is make some significant contributions to [combating] the opioid epidemic, and I think that our drug may do a better job to relieve pain than opioids,\u201d said Blum, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln biology professor.\n\nThe drug, named N-001 for now, is designed to avoid detrimental side effects of opioid use, addiction among them.\n\nOpioids dull pain in part by binding to opioid receptors found in regions of the brain that not only govern perception of pain, but also pleasure. They also act on receptors found in the brainstem, causing further reduction of pain, but also respiratory depression. For those who become addicted to opioids, and take larger and larger doses to chase the high, that restricted breathing is a key contributor to overdoses.\n\n\u201cThat epidemic is getting worse,\u201d Blum told potential investors at an IndieBio demo day event held this week. \u201cAlmost five people die every hour in America because they overdose on prescription medications.\u201d\n\n\n\nQ&A Why is there an opioid crisis in America? Show Hide Almost 100 people are dying every day across America from opioid overdoses \u2013 more than car crashes and shootings combined. The majority of these fatalities reveal widespread addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. The crisis unfolded in the mid-90s when the US pharmaceutical industry began marketing legal narcotics, particularly OxyContin, to treat everyday pain. This slow-release opioid was vigorously promoted to doctors and, amid lax regulation and slick sales tactics, people were assured it was safe. But the drug was akin to luxury morphine, doled out like super aspirin, and highly addictive. What resulted was a commercial triumph and a public health tragedy. Belated efforts to rein in distribution fueled a resurgence of heroin and the emergence of a deadly, black market version of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. The crisis is so deep because it affects all races, regions and incomes\n\nPavlik said that the years-long process of developing N-001 has been driven by the lack of treatment alternatives to the opioid.\n\n\u201cDoing drug development is one of the hardest things that there is,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that keeps me going. There\u2019s all these people out there, and there\u2019s so much suffering in the world.\u201d\n\nA growing number of companies and researchers are seeking to produce a challenger to, or a less addictive version of, opioids. There are multiple efforts to develop drugs that target the brain\u2019s cannabinoid receptors, with the intent of providing pain relief on par with marijuana use, but not the high associated with it or opioids.\n\nBiopharmaceutical company Nektar Therapeutics recently touted hase III trial results of an opioid with low blood-brain barrier penetration, \u201cdesigned to provide potent pain relief without the inherent high levels of euphoria which lead to abuse and addiction with standard opioids\u201d. Those methods are, like doses of oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl, systemic treatments, exposing tissue throughout the body and brain to their effects due to their presence in the bloodstream.\n\nUnlike those, N-001 is a localized treatment, Blum said, designed to target pain at its source via an injection or a topical solution. (Their drug, unlike the nearly 215 million opioid prescriptions written for Americans in 2016, would not come in pill form.) The Neurocarrus drug would not breach the blood-brain barrier as opioids do, Blum said. The company\u2019s slogan is: \u201cTreat the pain, not the brain.\u201d\n\nTo create their drug, Pavlik and Blum found inspiration in a wrinkle-reducer. While getting his PhD at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Pavlik researched proteins, and how they can be manipulated to serve vital functions.\n\nN-001 developed from interest in a specific kind of bacterial protein found in a toxin class called Clostridium botulinum. The protein is highly effective when it comes to delivering information into a cell. Botulinum toxins, though among the most poisonous biological substances, have proved useful in treating an array of medical conditions, including migraines and spastic movement disorders, by causing muscle paralysis. It also brought us Botox.\n\n\u201cBoth Ben and I were tuned into Botox,\u201d Blum said. \u201cIt\u2019s an injection, and people get it and it freezes motor neurons. What if we could do that to sensory neurons? That was the gee-whiz moment. And then we came up with a way to do it.\u201d\n\nThe drug binds to sensory neurons, enters the cells \u2013 \u201cNone of the other drugs do that,\u201d Blum said \u2013 and deposits a payload that quiets much of the electrical noise that pain produces in the peripheral nervous system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to develop a drug that locally turns down pain signals in order to prevent them from ever being transmitted to the brain,\u201d Pavlik said. \u201cAnd that will be useful for lots of localized, painful conditions.\u201d\n\nTrump calls for death penalties for drug dealers as focus of opioids plan Read more\n\nSince publishing promising in vitro test results in a 2016 Scientific Reports journal article, N-001 has been tested in animals, with mice receiving either injections of the experimental drug or an opioid. Blum said the mice that received N-001 showed signs of pain control that wore off after three days, compared to about one day for the mice in the control group that received an opioid dose. And, he said, the mice given N-001 showed no loss of muscular control.\n\nThey hope to begin US Food and Drug Administration-approved testing in humans by the end of 2019.

There have been generations of children who have been left at home with family members as their parents went to work in the UK, the US or Canada just to be able to provide for them.\n\nLater on, they were often sent for, once people\u2019s papers were in order. But even before the Windrush revelations, the prevailing mood was that the mother country was far from accommodating to this side of the family.\n\nIcilda Williams left Jamaica for the UK in May 1962, a few months before the island went from a colony to an independent nation.\n\nHer first passport was British; it was black and had the Queen\u2019s coat of arms and with Jamaica printed underneath; she was 27 years old and a subject.\n\n\u201cI think the British government forget what we went through, the hard work. The conditions in the hospitals were awful, we worked hard, raising our children, spending our money, buying houses, paying taxes, now we can\u2019t even go back and forth.\u201d\n\nNow aged 84, she settled in Bradford, had seven children and believed she would always have the right to stay in the country but in 2014 she travelled on holiday back to Jamaica and found she could not come back.\n\nShe had never applied for a British passport despite the fact she would have been eligible; a change in the law in 2014 meant that she needed to prove the time she had been in the UK but she did not have the evidence.\n\n\u201cI never got round to it,\u201d she says with resignation. \u201cI was busy raising my kids. I didn\u2019t have time \u2013 they were my priority.\u201d\n\nShe says the British government should still have the paperwork to prove when she arrived in the UK and without that proof, she\u2019s stuck in Jamaica.\n\nThe house she planned to spend part of her retirement in has become her permanent home. \u201cI\u2019m too old to wait in lines at the High Commission in Kingston, to go for interview after interview, we should be able to visit our families, my pension is in the UK, my house is there, my kids are there.\u201d\n\nHow can you send someone back who\u2019s never lived here or was raised here?\n\nThe vibe from the passengers coming out of Norman Manley international in Kingston is not like the island\u2019s other main airport, in Montego Bay, the resort destination. Here, those arriving are mainly either on business or coming home.\n\nAs the British Airways flight comes in from London, the red cap porters struggle with suitcases packed to capacity as reunions take place, wave after wave.\n\nV Anderson, who has just stepped off the the flight, is looking dapper. Now 74, the retired structural engineer from South West London was 14 when he arrived in the UK in early 1962. His parents were onboard some of the first ships to arrive in Tilbury in the 50s and he realises he could have been in the same situation as some of those currently caught up in this.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all bonkers, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery minute each government adds something else to the way they want it,\u201d referencing continual changes in UK immigration policy.\n\n\u201cI went up on a British passport but I did my papers straightaway in 1972 as soon as you could after 10 years but some people ignored it. But it doesn\u2019t matter, we were all British. How can you send someone back who\u2019s never lived here or was raised here?\u201d\n\nIt took him 41 years to travel back to the land of his birth and he understands how some could have fallen between the cracks in government policy.\n\nBut it was something that had been foreseen by many others, including Aloun Ndombet-Assamba, who served as High Commissioner for Jamaica in London between 2012 and 2016.\n\n\u201cWe put this on the agenda at Chogm (Commonwealth heads of government meeting) in Sri Lanka in 2013. How can one Commonwealth member pass laws that would effect other members so much? But promises were made to remove it from the communique\u201d?\n\nBut when she saw that many people who had been in the UK for decades were being directly affected, she travelled the country and pushed to get the people regularised as Jamaicans as quickly as possible, to use landing cards, school records, mortgage and NHS records as evidence of how long people had been in the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the home secretary and the prime minister have now acknowledged a great hurt and disservice was done to the Windrush generation. I\u2019m upset it\u2019s come to this but glad that hopefully these people will get their right to be there.\u201d\n\nBut this has opened up the way people here view the relationship with the UK: radio call-in shows and debates on TV do not normally focus on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting but things have got fiery on air.\n\nPeople want to know what the Jamaican authorities have done to stop some of these planned deportations, what support was given to those affected or were they treated like most regular deportees, the overstayers, the ones who got into trouble.\n\nFor some like Kimani, he believes that Jamaicans should not be treated as other foreign nationals because of the shared history. Now 38, he arrived in the UK as a 14-year-old. He served time in prison, which eventually led to his deportation.\n\n\u201cWe have the same Queen, the head of state in the UK is the head of state in Jamaica, how do you not recognise that?\u201d Kimani believes that many are in a similar situation faced by the Windrush generation. \u201cIn England I\u2019ve got my mum, my four kids. I\u2019ve been thrown back, my family ripped apart and destroyed for a mistake I\u2019ve already paid for.\u201d When he told officials the impact it would have on his family they told him to \u201cuse social media for communication\u201d.\n\nHe\u2019s going to continue to fight, but since returning to Jamaica he is starting afresh with some new opportunities provided by the British High Commission: it has sponsored him for a short media course at the University of the West Indies, something he says will help him to re-integrate, and broaden his horizons.\n\nBut later in the day I meet another man, Derek, who arrived back earlier this year. He\u2019s been staying at someone\u2019s house but they want him to move on. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking the street all day trying to find somewhere to stay,\u201d he says. The case of the Windrush generation and the speedy resolution that the government plans has given a false hope to people like Derek. \u201cHopefully they see people like me in a different way. I need them to look at my case.\u201d\n\nAs he explains that he overstayed in the UK for 17 years, and he breaks down the nuance of his case, of the family he\u2019s left behind and the life he has to somehow rebuild at the age of 60 in a country he barely recognises, I explain that it\u2019s unlikely this story will change his personal situation. He lets out a sigh that shakes his entire body and the table we\u2019re sitting at.

Show Hide What is it? The security council is the UN\u2019s most powerful body, the only one with the authority to issue legally binding resolutions that can be backed up by sanctions, blue-helmeted peacekeepers or by force of arms. Who is on it? There are five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \u2013 and 10 temporary members at any one time, elected by the general assembly for two-year terms. Why hasn\u2019t it taken stronger action against Syria? For a resolution to be passed, nine of the 15 council members must vote for it, but permanent members have a veto. Russia has repeatedly blocked resolutions targeting its ally, Syria. China has also vetoed resolutions on Syria. What can be done to solve the veto problem? One possible remedy is to expand the security council and its permanent membership, but the existing members have mixed feelings. The UK and France say they are in favour, the US and Russia are more tepid and China is against it. Another possible remedy involves reining in the use of the veto. France and others argue an immediate fix would be for permanent members to waive their veto rights in cases of mass atrocities, but Russia is adamant in its opposition.

The regime represses demonstrations in Damascus and the southern city of Deraa but protests continue. Defecting army colonel Riad al-Asaad sets up the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army. Islamist groups join the revolt. Regime forces take control of the rebel stronghold in Homs after a month of bombardment. Other bloody operations are carried out, notably in the central city of Hama, after massive anti-regime protests. FSA fighters launch a battle for Damascus but the government holds firm. More than 1,400 people die in a chemical weapon attack on rebel-held districts near Damascus. The US and Assad ally Russia agree a plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons, averting punitive US strikes against the regime. Hostilities between jihadists and rebel groups turn into an open war in the north. The group that will become known as Islamic State takes Raqqa \u2013 the first provincial capital to fall out of regime control \u2013 from rebel forces. A US-led coalition launches airstrikes against Isis in Syria. The strikes benefit Kurdish groups, which since 2013 have run autonomous administrations in Kurdish-majority areas. Russia launches airstrikes in support of Assad's troops, who are on the back foot. Russian firepower helps turn the tables for the regime, which begins to retake rebel-held territory. The regime retakes Syria's second city, Aleppo. Russia and Iran, as backers of the Syrian regime, and Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, organise talks in Kazakhstan, between representatives of both sides. The process leads to the creation of four \"de-escalation zones\". A sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun kills more than 80 people, prompting Washington to attack a regime airbase. Further complicating an already drawn-out conflict, Turkey launches an operation against the Kurdish People's Protection Units which, with US support, played a key role in beating back Isis. Regime launches a ferocious assault on the remaining rebel-held enclave near Damascus, eastern Ghouta. In under four weeks, the Russian-backed onslaught kills more than 1,200 civilians.\n\n\n\nThe only time they could remember the village hosting anything similar was when Sweden\u2019s King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Sylvia visited the farm in 2005 to celebrate the centenary of Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s birth.\n\nThen, they say, it poured with rain and, as the party made their way across the field to pay their respect at the meditation circle, Queen Sylvia\u2019s dress became near transparent while another attendee stepped in a cow pat, which went straight through her sandals.\n\nFortunately for the participants in Saturday\u2019s informal meeting, the house is set to be bathed in sunshine and a late-running winter means the cows have yet to released.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy that we have such great weather,\u201d said Erlandsson. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extra beautiful.\u201d\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/21/33-years-on-a-long-term-solution-to-live-export-trade-remains-elusive", "published": "2018-04-20T23:16:53", "title": "33 years on, a long-term solution to live export trade remains elusive", "text": "Reports show the economic importance of the industry is shrinking for everyone but the exporters themselves\n\nThe first parliamentary report decrying the cruelty of the Australian live export trade was delivered in 1985.\n\nLive sheep export, the senate report found, was not compatible with good animal welfare.

In another, armed men under his command murdered a villager, removed his heart and ordered the wife of the village chief to cook it. Jabbateh later had the chief murdered and ordered his widow to cook her husband\u2019s heart.\n\nTrial defence lawyers told the court Jabbateh had been framed by accusers who recounted \u201ctall tales of enemies settling old scores, not because they had personal experiences with him but because of what group he\u2019s identified with\u201d.\n\nWerner said: \u201cIt was a remarkable trial.

Their families spent days worrying, then heard gunshots crackling in the distance.\n\n\n\nHours later, they found the mutilated bodies, hastily buried five miles from their homes at the Maihkawng internal displacement camp in Myanmar\u2019s conflict-torn Kachin state.\n\nThey suspected that soldiers from Myanmar\u2019s army were responsible, but they didn\u2019t expect anything to happen to the perpetrators.\n\nOn Monday, in the UN\u2019s annual report detailing acts of violence carried out by armed forces in 2017, the Myanmar military was listed for the first time. The report, which was presented to the security council, found \u201cwidespread threat and use of sexual violence was integral to their strategy, humiliating, terrorising and collectively punishing the Rohingya community\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern of violence that the military, known locally as the Tatmadaw, has repeated for decades \u2013 kidnapping, torturing and murdering civilians with total impunity.\n\nHowever, this time was different. Shortly after the murders, a group of lawyers got in touch with the victims\u2019 relatives and encouraged them to give statements to the coroner and demand a post-mortem report. The result was a hand-scrawled document that detailed shattered skulls and bullet wounds, helping to make it impossible for the Tatmadaw to plausibly deny its soldiers\u2019 crimes.\n\nIn January, seven months after the killings, the six soldiers responsible were handed 10-year prison sentences by a court martial.\n\n\u201cWithout that report the soldiers wouldn\u2019t have been convicted,\u201d says Khun Naung, chairman of the Kachin Legal Aid Network, also known as Shingnip.\n\nIn a country where the army is considered untouchable, the lawyers have helped in recent years to secure a handful of rare convictions against soldiers who violate human rights. The group\u2019s 20 lawyers work pro bono and even pay rent out of their own pockets for the traditional wooden house that serves as their office.\n\nThey founded Shingnip in Kachin\u2019s capital, Myitkyina, in 2011, shortly after the breakdown of a 17-year ceasefire between the military and Kachin rebels caused a spike in abuses by government troops against civilians, says Khun Naung.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working on all the cases no one else dares to,\u201d says David Baulk, a Myanmar-based researcher for Fortify Rights, a group that monitored the Maihkawng case.\n\nWhile these convictions are a \u201cfirst step\u201d in the fight against impunity, he adds, they are a long way from delivering real justice. For one thing, most of the trial was held in secret. \u201cThe Tatmadaw kept the victims\u2019 families in the dark for about five months,\u201d says Baulk.\n\n\n\nThere are even doubts as to whether the convicted soldiers in this and other cases are actually serving their prison sentences because the authorities refuse to say where they\u2019re being held.\n\n\n\nEven so, with the police under military control, the investigative work of Shingnip and others is the closest thing to accountability for people in Myanmar\u2019s conflict zones.\n\nShingnip also helped secure a two-year manslaughter conviction last year against a soldier who had shot dead a student named Gum Seng Awng in front of several witnesses on the streets of Myitkyina. Most were too scared to talk, but Shingnip found two willing to give statements.\n\n\n\nThe sentence was much lighter than the family had hoped; Shingnip was pushing for the soldier to be tried for murder. But their work on the case led to the release of Gum Seng Awng\u2019s friends, who had been part of the altercation that led to his death. The military claimed the friends had tried to steal soldiers\u2019 guns and shoot them, but the witnesses disputed that.\n\nMyanmar accused of wiping out secret network of Rohingya reporters Read more\n\nOther claims were easier to debunk. \u201cThe soldier said in a press conference that he drove back to his base this way and was attacked by Gum Seng Awng on the way,\u201d says Khun Naung, sketching a crude map of Mytikyina on a whiteboard at his office.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense because there was a much shorter route, he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the soldier followed them and then the trouble started.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly why the military chooses to prosecute certain cases, but the work of activists, lawyers and journalists who uncover the truth is a major factor.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month a court martial sentenced seven soldiers and officers to 10 years in prison for taking part in a massacre of 10 Rohingya men during a military crackdown in Rakhine state that the UN says may amount to genocide.\n\n\n\nThe killings were uncovered by two Reuters journalists, who as a result are facing 14 years in prison under an official secrets law. One of the reporters, Wa Lone, had helped to expose another massacre in eastern Shan state in 2016, which led to five-year sentences for seven soldiers.\n\nIn both cases, the military did nothing to remedy the rules and policies that enable the abuse of civilians, says Sean Bain, legal consultant for Myanmar at the International Commission of Jurists, a group that promotes human rights and rule of law.\n\nThe Tatmadaw only admitted to the killings as a form of \u201cdamage control\u201d in the face of irrefutable evidence, he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s all window dressing.\u201d\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/20/congo-drc-award-winning-digital-activists-speak-out-president-joseph-kabila", "published": "2018-04-20T06:00:14", "title": "'Congo needs another voice': bloggers talk art, sex and football in DRC | Peter Beaumont", "text": "Index on Censorship honours a young collective sharing their experiences on social media of life in a land plagued by violence, corruption and poverty\n\nIn the midst of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s dangerous political crisis, the main media outlets have split almost entirely into pro-government and pro-opposition camps, most concentrated in the capital, Kinshasa.\n\nInformation has become as factionalised as politics, an echo chamber of competing narratives. Into that vacuum, however, a group of young Congolese bloggers has attempted to inject an alternative voice.\n\nLaunched in 2016, Habari RDC is a collective of more than 100 Congolese bloggers and web activists, who use Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to give voice to the opinions of young people from all over the DRC.\n\nThe collective won the Index on Censorship\u2019s digital activism award at a ceremony in London on Thursday.\n\nThe aim of these citizen bloggers is to bear witness to what is happening in every corner of the country, which is plagued by extreme poverty, corruption and violence.\n\nIt is a bold and ambitious project in a country where, as Reporters without Borders notes: \u201cFreedom of information is constantly violated and journalists are exposed to threats, physical violence, arrest, prolonged detention and even murder.\u201d\n\nHabari\u2019s digital presence brings a clear advantage \u2013 using virtual private networks to circumvent censorship, while hosting debate on the big social network used in Congo, Facebook, where its posts often attract 200 comments.\n\nIn London last week to receive the award, Guy Muyembe, one of Habari\u2019s founders, said: \u201cWe decided about two years ago that Congo needed another voice. It was important to us because our media tends to report only about the main Congolese leaders. The one voice you never hear is the voice of our country\u2019s young people \u2026 what their experience is.\u201d\n\nAnd in a country whose population is overwhelmingly young \u2013 with some 64% of its citizens under 24 and 42.2% under 14 \u2013 it is a crucial point.\n\nHabari RDC, as Muyembe explains, has emerged at a key juncture in DRC\u2019s fraught politics. Hopes of a new era of political stability under Joseph Kabila is under threat amid Kabila\u2019s unwillingness to stand down after he completes two terms as president.\n\nInstead, despite the St Sylvestre agreement of 2016 \u2013 which had foreseen Kabila\u2019s departure and elections in 2017 \u2013 Kabila stayed in power amid a deteriorating environment for human rights and freedom of expression.\n\nThat has coincided with a worsening humanitarian and security crisis that has seen tens of thousands of refugees flee into Uganda, Angola, Tanzania and Zambia in recent months to escape violence.\n\nLast week, the country\u2019s leadership decided to boycott a humanitarian donor conference, after arguing there was no urgent need in DRC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair enough,\u201d Muyembe says drily, adding briskly, \u201cbut then it is not in their interest to witness the country going badly.\u201d\n\nMuyembe is alarmed by the current political trajectory. \u201cThe country is not doing well and the political crisis is leading the economy to be degraded. Prices are going up every day. The cities are safe but that can\u2019t be said for the places in the country where there is conflict.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 agreement needs to be respected. The president can only be in power for 10 years and if it is not respected the situation will only get worse. I don\u2019t see the regime organising elections and relinquishing power.\u201d\n\nMuyembe believes that one important aspect of Habari is that it allows ordinary Congolese to express their views on what is going on in the country, unmediated by the political factions.\n\n\u201cThe worry is that if Kabila stays in power until 2020 or 2022 it will be like the past when the country was torn apart. And that feels like a real risk.\u201d\n\nMuyembe insists that Habari RDC is about more than the crisis. It also helps individuals \u2013 for instance, raising the plight of a woman who had been raped and was rejected by her family. It has reported on the suppression of the internet; and the use of road taxes to arm militias.\n\n\u201cThe point of the the site is to talk about life in DRC,\u201d he says. To that end, the site posts stories and cartoons about the country\u2019s politics, but it also covers football, the arts and subjects such as domestic violence, child exploitation, the female orgasm, and sexual harassment at work.\n\n\n\nHabari\u2019s impact has already gone beyond its vibrant commentary to effecting genuine change. One of its recent achievements was encouraging voter registration in Walikale Territory where, in the past, not only has engagement been low but people have disappeared from the register.\n\nAn article about registration resulted in a voter enrolment campaign that saw 290,000 people signed up to vote, including 140,000 women.\n\nCommenting on the value of Habari\u2019s work in DRC, Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship, said: \u201cHabari RDC brings young people\u2019s voices to the attention of decision-makers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The internet is one of the few areas where the government hasn\u2019t been able to exercise as much control, so it\u2019s a really important vehicle for free expression in the country.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/19/abuse-allegations-reported-to-charity-commission-double-in-a-month", "published": "2018-04-19T19:07:50", "title": "Steep rise in abuse claims to Charity Commission after Oxfam scandal", "text": "Reports of serious safeguarding incidents to the watchdog in February and March were three times figures for last year\n\nThe number of sexual abuse and harassment allegations reported to the Charity Commission has tripled since the Oxfam scandal.\n\nThe commission said it had received 532 new reports of serious safeguarding incidents across the sector in February and March this year, up from 176 in the same period last year.

Its importance as a prominent trading centre has made the market the target of three terror attacks since 1993.\n\n\n\nCongested, labyrinthine lanes house scores of jewellery workshops and factories, where gold is cut, carved, and shaped. Particles make their way into streets when craftsmen walk out \u2013 gold dust gets stuck to their hands, hair or shoes. The particles even get deposited in drains, when goldsmiths wash their hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn an average work day, I spend four hours collecting seven to eight pounds of filth and sludge from the streets,\u201d says Wasim Sheikh, 32, a native of the northern Indian city of Agra who migrated to Mumbai a decade ago to pursue his ancestral occupation. As with most other ghamelawallahs, generations of Sheikh\u2019s family have been in the informal trade.\n\n\u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve studied the bazaar closely; and now, I know exactly where workshops are, and where goldsmiths live. I usually target the crevices on pavements outside their workplaces, and drains outside their homes. On my best day, I found one and a half grammes of gold, worth 4,500 rupees [\u00a349].\u201d\n\nAfter he collects the waste, he submerges it in water. Gold, being heavier, sinks to the bottom, while the mud and dirt float out. He then carries the residue to a secluded corner outside his rented home in Zaveri bazaar, where he lights a tiny furnace to refine the yellow metal.\n\n\u201cI add mercury to the residue so that gold particles stick to it, and the trash gets separated. In order to filter out the finer waste \u2013 magnetic dust and ferrous particles, I carefully run a tiny magnet over the remains. I then add this residue to a furnace, where I cook it with nitric acid for about 10 to 12 minutes. The acid reacts with mercury to form liquid salts, leaving behind a pellet of gold.\u201d\n\nNot every day, however, is lucrative. Mohammed Amir, a 17-year-old, who quit school to join the profession, says the monsoons leave him and his four brothers, also ghamelawallahs, struggling.\n\n\u201cAll the dirt on the streets gets washed away with rainwater, while the gutters overflow, leaving no scope to identify sewage flecked with gold. Hence, during monsoons, my brothers and I take up other jobs \u2013 construction work, hawking at traffic signals or working as domestic labour in homes.\u201d\n\nThe Mumbai creche that means toddlers aren't left home alone | Priti Salian Read more\n\nGhamelawallahs usually collect a gramme or two of gold before selling it to small-time goldsmiths in the bazaar. Mohammed Babloo, 34, says the rates are often lower than market prices. \u201cThey tend to haggle with us because they think we\u2019re scavengers, living off sewage from gutters. I normally check rates with at least five buyers before parting with my gold.\u201d\n\nBut now jewellers, aware of the ghamelawallahs\u2019 work, are increasingly getting cautious about their waste, says Jaymin Zhaveri, a 30-year-old businessman, whose family has been running a jewellery store in the bazaar for 100 years. One shop owner has begun vacuuming and storing the dust.\n\n\u201cWorkshop owners have started giving uniforms to their craftsmen, which they have to leave behind after work so that gold dust on their clothes is retained with the employers. Others clean the pavements outside their stores themselves, and some even collect the water after goldsmiths wash their hands or shower. All of this waste is preserved over time, and sold to buyers from all over India in bulk,\u201d says Zhaveri.\n\nFor government street sweepers, meanwhile, the ghamelawallahs are a nuisance.

Women of colour were the least likely group to be on a board or a senior leadership team.\n\nThe agency Inclusive Boards, which conducted the research, described its findings as \u201calarming and significant\u201d.\n\nThis follows research last year by the Charities Commission that found charity trustees, who were older, highly educated, disproportionally white and disproportionally male, failed to reflect the communities they serve.\n\nThe new study, which examined 500 charities, will find particular resonance in the aid sector. Public trust in British charities has been hit by recent sexual abuse allegations and safeguarding scandals within Oxfam and Save the Children. Neither of the organisations, which are among the top 10 largest charities in England and Wales, had a single ethnic minority individual within senior leadership, researchers found, although both had trustees from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nSamuel Kasumu, the managing director of Inclusive Boards, said the findings were sobering.\n\n\u201cCharities champion some of the most marginalised people in the land and they receive such public goodwill and support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very sobering that they are doing so badly and it\u2019s alarming that organisations that are particularly well resourced within the sector are not able to attract diverse talents.\u201d\n\nHe said the 500 charities examined, with income of more than \u00a327m altogther, have had a 14.6% reduction in funding compared with two years ago.\n\nAlmost 80% of senior leadership teams in the top 500 charities lack any ethnic minority professionals, while 62% of the charities have all-white boards, the research found. Gender diversity, compared with other sectors, was \u201cbetter than most\u201d. However the analysis shows imbalance at the top. In a sector whose workforce is 65% female, men are still taking up almost 60% of senior leadership roles.\n\nInclusive Boards published similar research two years ago, but found \u201cinsufficient improvement\u201d \u2013 only a 0.3% increase in the levels of ethnic minority individuals on charity boards. It also found that the percentage of all-white boards had actually increased, by 5%.\n\nThe report found that out of 6,300 trustees, only 34% were female and only 2.9% women of colour. It criticises the Charity Commission and the Office for Civil Society for not making the case for greater diversity and recommended charities set strategies for improving diversity.\n\nVicky Browning, the CEO of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, quoted in the report, said: \u201cThe problem of ethnic diversity was well documented and discussed in the voluntary sector but this has not brought change. If action is not taken now, we will be commenting on the same figures in 2018 we were in 2008.\u201d\n\nPenny Mordaunt hails UK aid as a shield against crime, poverty and terrorism Read more\n\nSarah Atkinson of the Charities Commission said: \u201cRather than being something the regulator should enforce, diversity on trustee boards is an opportunity for charities to live their values. Charities stand for fairness and inclusion, and should be doing this because it is right and will enhance their work. Diversity of experience, approach and personality are all conducive to good governance and decision-making, allowing charities to work better for the people they are set up to help.\u201d\n\nShe said the organisation continues to press charities to report annually on diversity, in order to build on progress they have already made.\n\nA spokesman for Save the Children UK stressed that one of its board members, Babatunde Soyoye, managing partner of Helios Investment Partners, was from an ethnic minority background, while women accounted for four out of six executive director roles and 64% of the most highly paid jobs.\n\nClare Conaghan, human resource director of Save the Children UK, said the charity was developing a diversity strategy.\n\n\u201cLike other organisations in our sector, we know we must do better in drawing on the talents of a full range of candidates for every post,\u201d she said.\n\nOxfam said in a statement: \u201cWhen recruiting for senior level positions, we always seek to ensure we have the most diverse candidate pool possible, and that at least 50% of candidates are women. Currently a third of Oxfam\u2019s board of trustees belongs to an ethnic minority background. At present, none of the members of our senior leadership team belongs to an ethnic minority background, but this has not always been the case.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2018/apr/20/stonewalls-ruth-hunt-tells-owen-jones-my-heart-breaks-for-trans-communities-video-interview", "published": "2018-04-20T10:34:24", "title": "Stonewall's Ruth Hunt tells Owen Jones: 'My heart breaks for trans communities' \u2013 video interview", "text": "The Stonewall chief executive, Ruth Hunt, talks to Owen Jones about her shock at the level of vitriol directed at transgender men and women.

I don\u2019t see anything changing that,\u201d Corker said. The Tennessee Republican has clashed repeatedly with Trump and is not seeking re-election this year, but says he still talks to the president frequently on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see this administration trying in any way to shape what\u2019s happening on the ground as it relates to the regime,\u201d Corker said. \u201cWhen we invited Russia in \u2026 to help with chemical weapons, we basically turned the country over to Russia. It\u2019s Russia\u2019s and Iran\u2019s [call] to determine what is going to happen in Syria. When you\u2019re not helping shape what\u2019s on the ground and you\u2019re in diplomatic meetings, you\u2019re just talking.\u201d\n\nCorker argued that faced with the burden of stabilising and rebuilding Syria, Russia and Iran would come around to the US point of view that this is not feasible while Assad remains in power.\n\nObama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, made a similar argument this week, noting that the Trump and Obama administrations had faced similar dilemmas in Syria and come up with similar policies. The capacity of the US and its allies to finance the reconstruction of Syria would give Washington leverage at the negotiating table that it did not have through boots on the ground, Rice said.\n\n\u201cWithout our money, Russia and Iran, neither economic powerhouses, will be left holding the bag on a costly failed state,\u201d she wrote in a New York Times commentary.\n\nAs the US has found in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, however, the complex civil wars of foreign countries, once entered, are very hard to quit. There is little reason to believe Syria will break that pattern, however reluctant and instinctively isolationist the American commander-in-chief.\n\nTrump has sought to limit US war aims in Syria to two: resoundingly defeating Isis and deterring the use of chemical weapons. Even with such tightly defined objectives, US withdrawal is likely to be messy.\n\nBoth goals, however concrete, could still prove elusive. Even after last week\u2019s air strikes, Trump has left his red lines on chemical weapons blurred. It\u2019s not clear if the US will intervene again if only chlorine is used in an attack, or whether the use of nerve agent would be necessary to trigger further punitive strikes. The Assad regime, which has used chlorine to clear rebel-held pockets, can be expected to test that boundary.\n\nDefeating Isis could also prove to be one of those tasks the US and its allies are perpetually on the brink of achieving. The group\u2019s propaganda talks of a dormant phase, with sleeper cells ready to regenerate whenever the military pressure lets up.\n\n\u201cBased on recent trends of increased attacks and Isis\u2019s apparent push to fully revitalise sleeper cells, we can expect further increases in the group\u2019s activities in the coming months,\u201d Hassan Hassan, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, wrote in the National.\n\nExtremist groups like Isis also mutate in ways that make them hard to destroy outright. In southern Syria, an Isis offshoot called Jaysh Khalid bin al-Waleed (JKW) is on the rise and has not so far been targeted by either the regime or the US-led counter-Isis coalition.\n\nJKW\u2019s ascent is due in part to Trump\u2019s decision to cut off an Obama-era train-and-equip programme for the Free Syrian Army in the south, which is now being squeezed by the regime and the new extremist group. Keeping Isis from regenerating in the north is likely to require sticking with Kurdish allies there. US Central Command has conceded that the Turkish offensive against the Kurds has crippled efforts against Isis strongholds in the mid-Euphrates valley.\n\nCorker said he could envisage a reduced US contingent helping in those areas with \u201con-the-ground governance\u201d. That could in turn imply indefinite military support for Kurdish forces in the north, who are under pressure from all sides, including Turkey, a Nato ally.\n\nAnother alliance could pull the US back in for reasons quite unconnected with its present war aims. An Israel-Iran conflict is simmering, as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) establishes airfields and bases ever closer to Israeli territory. It is hard to imagine the US standing on the sidelines of such a conflict, if it erupts.\n\nStaying out of that fight will be all the harder if Trump goes ahead with his stated intent of taking the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran next month. If Tehran responds by stepping up uranium enrichment, the Gulf is likely to slide once more to the brink of a major new war, in which Syria can be expected to be a central battlefield.\n\nTrump has never shied away from contradictions and his Syrian policy is no exception. The president seems bent on a stand-off with Iran over its nuclear programme, at the same time as he seeks to duck a confrontation with Iran in Syria. It is going to be increasingly difficult to to do both at the same time."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkey-president-election-dictator-seeks-total-control", "published": "2018-04-19T04:00:05", "title": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: a dictator in all but name seeks complete control | Simon Tisdall", "text": "Turkey\u2019s president is unlikely to lose an election that will make him more powerful than Atat\u00fcrk\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is one of a crop of present-day political leaders who value the respectability an ostensibly democratic election confers but don\u2019t want to risk actually losing the vote.\n\nIn this respect, Turkey\u2019s president is no different from Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Their shared idea of democracy can be summed up by the motto: \u201cYou vote, I win.\u201d\n\nIt is possible Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) could lose the snap presidential and parliamentary polls called for 24 June. But it is extremely unlikely. The AKP won a clear majority of seats in parliament in 2015 and is already assured of the support, should it need it, of the Nationalist Movement party (MHP).\n\nAs for Erdo\u011fan, he remains Turkey\u2019s dominant politician, a position he has occupied for a decade or more at home, in contrast to the steady decline in his international standing. He is also a deeply divisive figure. A recent survey by Metropoll gave him a nationwide approval rating of 49.8%. Just over 42% of respondents said they disapproved.\n\nEven if there were a politician of sufficient power and prestige to effectively challenge Erdo\u011fan \u2013 and there isn\u2019t \u2013 the odds are stacked against any would-be usurper. Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the likeable but ineffective leader of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s party (CHP), gained only 19% approval in the same poll.\n\nQ&A What happened in the Turkish referendum and why does it matter? Show Hide On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdo\u011fan sweeping new powers. The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system \u2013 arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923. Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June \u2013 Erdo\u011fan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029. The new laws will notionally allow Erdo\u011fan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament\u2019s role to amend legislation and much more. The president's supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\n\nErdo\u011fan has sidelined old comrades such as Abdullah G\u00fcl and Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, formerly president and prime minister respectively, ensuring nobody within the AKP is in a position to rival him. And since the failed 2016 coup, he has systemically emasculated rival power bases and independent media, locking up pro-Kurdish lawmakers and journalists and sacking tens of thousands of civil servants, academics, military, police and judges on specious grounds of national security.\n\nIn such circumstances, the prospect of truly competitive, open, free and fair elections is slim to non-existent. In a very real sense, Erdo\u011fan, himself a one-time prison inmate who came up the hard way, has been waiting for this moment all his life. If and when he wins, he will assume the full powers of the new \u201cexecutive presidency\u201d that was narrowly voted through in last year\u2019s bitterly contested constitutional referendum.\n\nElections had not been due for another 18 months. By bringing the polls forward, Erdo\u011fan is finally set to gain full, personal control of all key aspects of domestic and foreign policy. He will become a dictator in all but name, more powerful perhaps than even Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, modern, secular Turkey\u2019s founding father.\n\nWorried politicians in Paris, Berlin, London and Washington no longer see a reliable friend and ally in Ankara. They see an autocratic figure exploiting nationalist and neo-Islamist sentiment, xenophobia and Europhobia, and feelings of public insecurity brought on by next door\u2019s Syrian crisis, to justify egregious human rights abuses, institutional vandalism and anti-EU, anti-western policies.\n\nTurkey under Erdo\u011fan, though still a Nato member, is now closely aligned with Russia. In Syria, Erdo\u011fan has backed Moscow and Tehran in pursuing a political and territorial settlement that would keep Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in place, even though he had previously demanded the Syrian leader resign.\n\nIn return, Moscow gave tacit support to Turkey\u2019s recent military incursion into Afrin, in north-west Syria, in furtherance of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s obsessive vendetta with the Syrian (and Iraqi) Kurds \u2013 all of whom he denounces as terrorists. On past precedent, inflammatory anti-Kurdish rhetoric will play a big part in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s re-election bid. The need to be \u201cstrong\u201d in Afrin was one reason for calling early polls, he said on Wednesday.\n\nPutin and, for example, China\u2019s Xi Jinping, another executive president-forever, may be impressed by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s dubious ascendancy. Iran\u2019s hardliners may cheer him on. But the western democracies, which Turks for many years aspired to emulate, will not. For them, Turkey is increasingly on the wrong side of a global argument between freedom and control."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2018/apr/20/jacinda-ardern-quotes-maori-proverb-during-commonwealth-toast-video", "published": "2018-04-20T07:27:58", "title": "Jacinda Ardern quotes M\u0101ori proverb during Commonwealth toast - video", "text": "New Zealand prime minister proposes a toast to the future of the Commonwealth at a dinner hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace.

The five points of the plan are: Pledge to vote on gun safety; research how much money local officials have accepted from the National Rifle Association, register friends to vote; force candidates to go on the record about gun policy through a provided candidate questionnaire; and urge people who are involved to run for office themselves.\n\nIan Berlin, 17, a student at a D.C. high school who told Breitbart News he organized the local protest, spoke from a small stage set up on the West Lawn of the Capitol.\n\nBerlin said there are rules and regulations on the First Amendment, citing the permits the group needed to put on the protest.\n\n\u201cAnd so too must we regulate the Second Amendment,\u201d Berlin said. \u201cJust as the freedoms of the First Amendment are subject to rules and regulation so too must be those protected under the Second.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo amendment is absolute,\u201d Berlin said. \u201cYour right to a gun does not supersede my right to graduate high school.\u201d\n\nThe teen noted that he was born shortly after the Columbine attack, and the government has taken \u201cno meaningful action to protect our schools and our communities from this epidemic of gun violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo to the politicians, I say you\u2019ve had 19 years and now you have until November,\u201d Berlin said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t act, we will vote you out.\u201d\n\nAnother teen, Micaela Lattimer, 17, and a junior at Long Reach High School in Columbia, Maryland, said the anti-gun movement must be \u201cintersectional\u201d \u2014 a decades-old feminist social theory that \u201casserts that people are often disadvantaged by multiple sources of oppression: their race, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and other identity markers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntersectionality recognizes that identity markers (e.g. \u201cfemale\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d) do not exist independently of each other, and that each informs the others, often creating a complex convergence of oppression.\u201d\n\nLattimer said that the people who died at Columbine and in Parkland, Florida, are not the only victims of \u201cgun violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here because when black activists have taken to the street to protest police shootings, members of law enforcement have responded in full riot gear and arrests,\u201d Lattimer said, citing statistics she claims show that black men and Latinos are at much higher risk of dying from being shot.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep this intersectional,\u201d Lattimer said.\n\nThe protesters also embraced the LGBT community and its link to \u201cgun violence,\u201d including suicide by a gunshot wound.\n\nA teen from a high school in Rockville, Maryland, said she wanted to share her \u201cidentity\u201d and then pointed out that \u201cqueer youth\u201d are five times more likely to attempt suicide than their \u201ccisgender, heterosexual counterparts.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the National School Walkout was started by Lane Murdock, a 16-year-old teen in Connecticut, after the Florida shootings.\n\nBut her efforts were also boosted by liberal adults \u2014 in Murdock\u2019s case, by the group Indivisible, which states on its website:\n\nOur mission is to fuel a progressive grassroots network of local groups to resist the Trump Agenda.

Tillis, Capito, Young, and Burr Back Obama-Era EPA Trucking Rule", "text": "Four GOP establishment senators and ten House Republicans signed a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt, asking him to save an Obama-era trucking rule.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Thursday that Sens. Todd Young (R-IN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Richard Burr (R-NC) all signed onto a letter urging Pruitt to save an Obama-era glider truck emissions regulation.\n\nHouse Republicans such as Reps. David Valadao (R-CA), Mark Sanford (R-SC), and Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-WV) also backed the letter.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the EPA created a new rule to regulate glider trucks the same way as new trucks. Glider trucks are built by pairing a new chassis with an older diesel engine and powertrain. Glider trucks cost roughly 25 percent less compared to new trucks, making them more affordable for America\u2019s trucking industry.\n\nSteve Milloy, a Trump EPA transition team member, contends that the Obama-era regulation \u201cwould have essentially shuttered the glider industry.\u201d\n\nSens. Capito, Tillis, and Burr have not responded to a request for comment from Breitbart News about their support for an Obama-era trucking regulation.\n\nSen. Young\u2019s office responded a to Breitbart News in a statement, saying, \u201cSenator Young believes Hoosier manufacturers, trucking fleets, and job creators need regulatory certainty and the EPA should carefully consider how any changes could undermine significant investments Hoosier stakeholders have already made.\u201d\n\nCarl Howard, the vice president and general manager of H&H Freightliner, a North Carolina trucking company, reacted to the news that Sen. Burr supports the Obama-era trucking rule in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News.\n\nHoward told Breitbart News:\n\nThe EPA rule eliminates our glider business in 2020. Without a new means to replace these sales we will see about a 40 percent decrease in vehicle sales. The term \u201cdecades of consistent regulation\u201d regarding this is a joke. The only thing consistent with the regulation is that it changes. I think someone has pulled the wool over Burr\u2019s eyes regarding this, and pretty disappointed he did not look at his constituents, or manufacturers in his state. The largest manufacturer of the unassembled kits and new trucks has 2 plants in North Carolina. The manufacturers against it are not doing it for environmental concerns, they are doing it because they do not produce glider kits. Who wouldn\u2019t support a possible reduction in competition? Further, the perception is false that gliders put dirty trucks on the road, old worn out dirty trucks are pulled off and replaced with gliders. They replace dirty trucks, not create them.\n\nBreitbart News revealed in an exclusive report in March that Congressman Jenkins originally denied and then admitted to sending a letter urging lawmakers to support protection of the Obama-era EPA trucking regulation.\n\nIn a statement to Breitbart News, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who is running against Jenkins in the 2018 West Virginia Republican Senate primary, said, \u201cit\u2019s clear Evan Jenkins has not abandoned his Democratic past.\u201d\n\nLarge trucking manufacturers such as Volvo and Navistar, fleet owners such as the United Parcel Service (UPS), and the National Association of Manufacturers, have lobbied to preserve the Obama-era glider regulation.\n\nTerry Dotson, president of Worldwide Equipment Enterprises, which makes trucks that compete with glider trucks, supports the Obama-era EPA regulation. Dotson argued that \u201ceverybody ought to play by the same set of rules.\u201d\n\nDotson donated to Sen. Young\u2019s and Rep. Sanford\u2019s campaigns right before both lawmakers signed onto the letter supporting the glider rule.\n\nRep. Jenkins told Breitbart News in March that Worldwide Equipment first reached out to him regarding the glider trucking rule, leading to Jenkins circulating the letter around Capitol Hill to find other signatories.\n\nJenkins told Breitbart News:\n\nI was contacted about the issue by Worldwide Equipment in West Virginia, which Vice President Pence visited just a few weeks ago to praise their new investments thanks to tax reform. After this major local employer shared with me how this regulation is threatening jobs in West Virginia, I drafted a different letter regarding the issue that reflects the concerns of my constituents.\n\nHonored to be here at Worldwide Equipment in White Sulphur Springs with CEO Terry Dotson. Vice President Pence will be arriving shortly! @VP pic.twitter.com/HO3cEnVeZx \u2014 Rep. Evan Jenkins (@RepEvanJenkins) January 31, 2018\n\nLane Parker, president of Trinity Transport, a small trucking company that has invested in glider trucks, argues that keeping the EPA glider rule will only hurt his business and the environment. Parker argues in a letter to Pruitt how \u201cGliders are not new vehicles and should not be subject to the same laws as new vehicles.\u201d\n\nParker added:\n\nThese new rules would force smaller trucking companies to keep running older trucks, which are much more harmful to the environment, but more economical to operate. It needs to be noted that newer model Gliders are much more environmentally friendly than continuing to keep older trucks on the road indefinitely, which is what will ultimately happen.\n\nLast November, the EPA under Administrator Scott Pruitt moved to shield the glider truck industry from the Obama-era rule.\n\nThe agency wrote:\n\nIn proposing a new interpretation of the relevant statutory language, EPA now believes that its prior reading was not the best reading, and that the Agency failed to consider adequately the most important threshold consideration: i.e., whether or not Congress, in defining \u2018new motor vehicle\u2019 \u2026 had a specific intent to include \u2026 such a thing as a glider vehicle \u2013 a vehicle comprised both of new and previously owned components.\n\nParker suggested that if the EPA decides to keep the EPA rule, then small trucking businesses such as his will \u201cbe forced into difficult financial situations,\u201d which will make it harder to compete against larger trucking companies."}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/faVN94kVQss/", "published": "2018-04-20T22:17:40", "title": "Fresno State\u2019s Randa Jarrar Believes Leftist Activists Should Be Using Violence", "text": "According to a video from 2016, embattled Fresno State Professor Randa Jarrar laments the fact that progressives no longer utilize terrorist acts like hijacking planes.\n\n\u201cBarbara Bush was a generous and smart and amazing racist who, along with her husband, raised a war criminal.

If this had been done in the Parkland situation, that horrific tragedy could have been avoided.\n\nLed by the D.C.-based American Principles Project (APP), the leaders sent a letter to the House Education and Workforce Committee. The letter expresses the concern that even more data-sharing is possibly being encouraged following the Parkland shooting:\n\nIn the wake of the Florida school shooting, the White House has encouraged a review of FERPA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Unfortunately, the context of this statement suggests the goal of enhancing data-sharing in the sensitive area of student mental health: \u201creviews will determine if any changes or clarifications are needed to improve coordination between mental health and other healthcare professionals, school officials, and law enforcement personnel.\u201d We caution that such increased \u201ccoordination\u201d in sharing such student data can be extraordinarily dangerous.\n\n\u201c[I]t is crucial to recognize that if the legal and mental-health procedures already in place had been properly followed \u2013 and if the local school had not gutted its disciplinary procedures in response, at least in part, to federal pressure \u2013 this horrific crime would not have happened,\u201d the leaders continue. \u201cThe solution is to enforce laws and implement policies already on the books, not subject vast numbers of innocent students to further invasion of privacy.\u201d\n\nThe leaders make five recommendations for the revision of FERPA:\n\nDo whatever is possible to decrease the amount of data collected on students, especially social-emotional learning (SEL) data. Collection of such data should be eliminated or at the very least a) not collected without informed opt-in parental consent and b) be treated as medical data. Treat whatever mental health, social emotional, or behavioral data collected for special-education evaluations or any other related program, such as Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) or Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS), as medical data that cannot be housed in longitudinal databases. Use aggregate rather than individual data to the greatest extent possible. Obtain parental consent if data collected for one purpose is to be repurposed or shared with another federal agency. Eliminate the current language in FERPA allowing predictive testing.\n\n\u201cPersonal data collection without consent is an affront to freedom,\u201d said Emmett McGroarty, APP senior fellow and co-author of the new book, Deconstructing the Administrative State: The Fight for Liberty. \u201cThe federal government has no right or authority to vacuum up mountains of personal data on its citizens without their consent, with only the vague intent to \u2018help\u2019 them or others make decisions.

She told Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak that some of her clients have been \u201cblackballed\u201d by \u201csupposedly neutral hiring platforms.\u201d\n\nDhillon said, \u201cI\u2019ll have some troubling developments next week about people\u2019s job searches and how I believe Silicon Valley companies are actively trying to blacklist people through some hiring engines. Some of the top companies that do the hiring, matching people with jobs and job seekers, are blackballing people who talk out. That\u2019s a developing new story.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nDhillon added, \u201cI\u2019m seeing clients of mine being blackballed by supposedly neutral hiring platforms where their accounts just get deactivated overnight.\u201d\n\nDhillon spoke of racial and sexual considerations Google used in its human resource policies in pursuit of \u201cdiversity.\u201d She said, \u201c[My] three new plaintiffs are three highly qualified white men who identify as conservatives online who were denied jobs at Google, and it turns out that either the positions remained open or people with lesser qualifications ended up being hired for those positions. So that\u2019s kind of classic employment discrimination that you see in gender cases and cases brought by people who are traditionally on the left.\u201d\n\nDhillon explained that Google, like Starbucks, mandates its employees attend \u201cworkshops\u201d ostensibly combating \u201cunconscious bias.\u201d She stated, \u201cSome of the other things that are included in the new complaint are some internal documents that Google gives its managers about unconscious bias. We\u2019ve seen this a lot in the news with regard to the Starbucks issue, and Starbucks will be closing itself down to do this unconscious bias training, and I suspect that they\u2019re going to be hearing a lot of the same type of rhetoric as Google is already giving to its hiring managers and managers generally, which is that, basically, some pretty gross stereotypes about white people, about how they are all about \u2018meritocracy,\u2019 and they talk about people behind their backs; they don\u2019t talk to their faces \u2014 ridiculous stereotypes that anybody who\u2019s worked in America knows are not true. Apparently, it\u2019s the last frontier of acceptability to slander white people in our culture. What\u2019s ironic is that [James Damore] was fired for allegedly perpetuating gender stereotypes, yet Google clearly perpetuates race and gender stereotypes every day in its HR policies; it\u2019s just that they\u2019re the political version, so they get away with it.\u201d\n\nDhillon recalled a senior engineer at Google suggesting sabotage of President Donald Trump\u2019s Android-based mobile phone. She remarked, \u201cOne of the senior software engineers [at Google] in an all-hands meeting said that Google should consider bricking the president\u2019s phone because [Trump] uses an Android device, and also shutting down the Gmail accounts of White House staffers because they don\u2019t deserve to have those types of accounts. That hasn\u2019t happened, mind you, but that\u2019s the mentality that is sort of laughed at and accepted as a normal thing to say at Google. It\u2019s very foreign to most of us Americans.\u201d\n\nDhillon praised Breitbart News\u2019s reporting of Silicon Valley\u2019s politicking. She said, \u201cBreitbart has done a good job. I think Allum Bokhari wrote the story about Google\u2019s marketing team openly instructing customers of theirs not to serve ads next to so-called right-wing sites. Breitbart is called out, but other sites that are called out for discrimination by the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups like that. We believe the SPLC is one of the shipping lists by which Google marketing managers use, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the exclusive source for their discrimination.\u201d\n\nDhillon added, \u201cWhat\u2019s most insidious about this is that people don\u2019t know, so consumers who are using the search engine to find information are not being told that the engine results and advertising service are biased. People who invest in advertising are not necessarily aware of the biases in the system, and that, I think, is troubling for consumers, and maybe something that government should be looking at in terms of deceptive advertising.\u201d\n\nDhillon said technology companies lobby against domestic adoption of European-style regulations pertaining to \u201cprivacy guidelines.\u201d She observed, \u201cOne of the things that I know as a tech lawyer in Silicon Valley is that every tech company, including clients of my firm \u2026 are scrambling to comply with European privacy guidelines that are coming into effect very shortly, and yet, all the effort on their lobbying front is to make sure that the same privacy guidelines don\u2019t occur here in America. I don\u2019t think Americans are fully aware that A) these companies loathe conservatives, many of them, and mistreat their employees who are conservative, and B) while their motto is \u2018Don\u2019t Be Evil,\u2019 they are, at the same time, advocating that the same privacy rights that people in foreign countries have with respect to their products do not exist in America.\u201d\n\nDhillon commented on technology firms\u2019 lobbying efforts in Washington, DC. She said, \u201cThey have a carefully crafted facade of being a neutral company. \u2026 D.C. is a swamp, and every single member of Congress or senator I know is constantly in fundraising mode, and tech companies are writing them checks.\u201d\n\nDhillon warned conservatives against apathy on threats to privacy and Fourth Amendment protections coming from technology companies and the state. She said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of critical thinking on [privacy issues]. \u2026 We see the same lack of critical thinking and inconsistency in our privacy with regard to government spying and Fourth Amendment and search and seizure issues. There are a number of issues where Americans \u2014 and I have to say conservatives \u2014 are like sheep, and they\u2019re sheep being led to the slaughter without critically examining what it is that the government is doing and what it is that their government is allowing big corporations that are \u2018too big to fail\u2019 to do to us. This is no different than the mortgage crisis, and some other crises in our country where some companies are just too big to fail, and they have spread so much money in so many people\u2019s pockets on both sides of the aisle that there\u2019s nobody left to speak for the consumers.\u201d\n\nMansour opined, \u201cOne of the civil rights battles of our day [is] this digital fight for free speech.\u201d\n\nDhillon cautioned observers against thinking that racial policies related to \u201cunconscious bias\u201d programs are restricted to Silicon Valley. She said, \u201cIt is not just tech; you\u2019re seeing it at Starbucks. Baristas are being forced to kowtow to this concept of unconscious bias and, somehow, self-flagellation because of their race and assumptions being made about them. Anybody who thinks this is limited to Silicon Valley is fooling themselves. Today, it\u2019s James Damore.

In fact, it is illegal to buy a new or used firearm at retail without passing such a check. Universal background checks are the same, exact checks we have now \u2013 they simply apply to private sales as well as retail. But a background check is a background check.\n\nAnd guess what? Parkland gunman Nikolas Cruz passed a background check for the rifle he used in the February 14 attack. Yet students are walking out to expand the point-of-sale scenarios in which other would-be gun buyers must pass the same check Cruz passed.\n\nMoreover, CNN reports that students walked out in support of a ban on bump stocks. But bump stocks were not used in the Parkland shooting. In fact, bump stocks have only been used criminally once\u2013the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas attack.\n\nThe students also walked out for \u201cwaiting periods\u201d on gun purchases \u2013 he same waiting periods that already exist in California, where Elliot Roger shot and killed three on May 23, 2014, in Santa Barbara; Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik shot and killed 14 in San Bernadino on December, 2, 2015; Albert Wong shot and killed three at the Yountville Veterans home on March 9, 2018; and Nasim Aghdam shot and wounded three at YouTube headquarters on April 3, 2018.\n\nThe students are also demanding the legal age for buying a long gun be raised to 21, that firearm confiscation orders be enacted, and that \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines be banned.\n\nEfforts to ban \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines are misplaced, at best.

In reality, the exact opposite is true.\n\nWaPo\u2019s Philip Bump, whose documented credibility problems have even caught the attention of the New York Times, is using straight up falsehoods in an attempt to exonerate Comey, while falsely painting President Donald Trump as a liar.\n\nFriday morning, Trump tweeted that Comey had \u201cleaked classified information\u201d by leaking memos about his conversation with the president to the media through an intermediary, Columbia law professor Daniel Richman.\n\nThere are seven memos. Per Comey\u2019s own intermediary, Comey leaked four of them to him. And now we know that \u201cMore than half of the memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have been determined to contain classified information, according to interviews with officials familiar with the documents.\u201d\n\nSo, if 1) there are seven memos and 2) more than half contained classified information and 3) Comey leaked four, 4) the math informs us that Comey leaked classified information.\n\nWaPo\u2019s painful attempt to exonerate Comey actually contradicts itself. Hidden beneath a misleading headline that reads \u201cThe Comey memos bolster his claim that he didn\u2019t leak classified information,\u201d and nearly ten paragraphs of the left-wing Bump attacking Trump, WaPo is actually forced to admit Comey did in fact leak classified information:\n\nIn July of last year, Fox News reported that Richman had told them that he had received four memos from Comey. (It appears to be the only outlet to have reported this.) Slate theorizes that this is why Republicans wanted the memos to be released: After all, if four of the seven memos included classified information (as was known before Thursday\u2019s release), then, if he received four documents, Richman must have received at least one document that was classified. The release of the memos, though, make clear that the memo which we know Comey gave to Richman wasn\u2019t classified. Slate asked Richman to clarified [sic] what he had received, without response; they speculate that perhaps Richman received four pages of documents.\n\nThe sleight-of-hand here, the audacious dishonesty, is reminiscent of Bump\u2019s attempt to fabricate 355 mass shootings and to wish away the radicalism a credible poll found in a disturbing number of American Muslims.\n\nTo begin with, Comey\u2019s intermediary, Richman, told Fox News he received four memos. Period.\n\nMoreover, Richman has never disputed he received four memos, never backtracked, never claimed he misspoke to Fox News, never said that Fox News misquoted him. And the idea that a Columbia law professor does not know the difference between four pages and four memos, is laughably desperate.\n\nNevertheless, Bump still wants us to believe the left-wing Slate\u2019s speculation (which is based on no reporting, merely wishful thinking) that Richman confused pages with memos is a more important fact than Richman stating on the record that he received four memos and never backing off that claim, despite many opportunities to do so.\n\nYes, that is what Bump is basing his speculation on \u2014 on the hope that what Richman himself said is not true. [UPDATE: Bump\u2019s absurd thesis just got blown away with the Wall Street Journal report that says Comey is now under investigation by the Justice Department for leaking at least two memos that contained classified info.]\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it makes perfect sense that Richman has remained silent. When he told Fox News he was in possession of four of the seven memos, meaning that at least one of them contained classified information, he might have accidentally dropped Comey into a world of hurt. Were Richman to change his story now, it would put his credibility in serious jeopardy.\n\nRegardless, Richman does not need to change his story when he has the Washington Post doing it for him!\n\nBump also tries to make the case that even if Comey did leak memos containing classified information, he is still not guilty of leaking classified information because, at the time they were leaked, the memos were not yet marked classified.\n\nEven if true, this is irrelevant \u2026\n\n1) Comey still leaked classified information.\n\n2) To quote Comey himself, \u201c[E]ven if information is not marked \u2018classified\u2019 in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t wait for Bump to spin us all on how an FBI director could not have known his private conversations with the president were classified.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The DOJ IG\u2019s office had pointed to an existing investigation on Comey, but did not say whether it would be expanded to include the leaking of the memos.\n\nWSJ\u2018s report indicated that the inspector general took up the investigation.

So, again, I\u2019ll quote at length in the hopes of being fair in my assessment, this time the book\u2019s closing paragraph: \u201cTrans* bodies, in their fragmented, unfinished, broken-beyond-repair forms, remind all of us that the body is always under construction. Whether trans* bodies are policed in bathrooms or seen as killers and loners, as thwarted, lonely, violent, or tormented, they are also a site for invention, imagination, fabulous projection. Trans* bodies represent the art of becoming, the necessity of imagining, and the fleshy insistence of transitivity.\u201d Once again, after reading that passage a couple of times, I think I understand, sort of, the point. But, once again, I don\u2019t see how it advances our understanding of sex and gender, of patriarchy and power. I am not alone in this assessment; people I know, including some who are sympathetic to the transgender movement\u2019s political project, have shared similar concerns, though they often mute themselves in public to avoid being labeled transphobic.\n\nTo read more about the transgender ideology\u2019s goal to end the nation\u2019s two-sex society, click here. For Breitbart\u2019s coverage of feminism and transgenderism, click here, here, here or here.\n\nNationwide, the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.\n\nMultiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology.\n\nDespite the huge expense, conflict, and damage to young people, the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nTherapist sees woman for ONE MONTH before prescribing a double mastectomy and hormones.

Bridenstine has previously expressed scientifically inaccurate and skeptical views about climate change. Speaking on the House floor in 2013, he incorrectly said that global temperatures stopped rising 10 years earlier. In a 2016 interview with Aerospace America, Bridenstine argued that the climate is simply always changing. During a confirmation hearing for the NASA administrator post in November, Bridenstine attested to the existence of climate change and humankind\u2019s role in it, but would not say if humans were the primary contributors to climate change. The current consensus, according to NASA, is that \u201cclimate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.\u201d\n\nStill, Bridenstine\u2019s confirmation will be good news for those old-fashioned types among us who believe that NASA\u2019s main job should be space exploration, rather than promoting Muslim outreach or bolstering the climate alarmist narrative with faked data."}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Tj3UrPq9630/", "published": "2018-04-20T19:59:34", "title": "Avicii, Two-Time Grammy Nominated DJ-Producer Dies at 28", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Avicii, the Grammy-nominated electronic dance DJ who performed sold-out concerts for feverish fans around the world and also had massive success on U.S. pop radio, died Friday.

CNN\u2019s report resulted in worldwide coverage of the dossier charges.\n\nIn its report, CNN noted that the dossier claims were circulating for months among the news media, and that the inclusion of the dossier claims in the briefing with Trump and another with President Obama gave the charges some credibility.\n\nLast night, the redacted and declassified sections of Comey\u2019s 15 pages of memos were released after the documents were sent to Congress by the Justice Department.\n\nComey recounts a January 6, 2017 briefing with President-Elect Trump at Trump Tower at which he informed Trump about the dossier allegations after other officials left the room and the two of them were alone.\n\nComey says he told Trump that he was briefing him in part because CNN was looking to run with the story:\n\nI said I wasn\u2019t saying this was true, only that I wanted him to know both that it had been reported and that the reports were in many hands. I said media like CNN had them and were looking for a news hook. I said it was important that we not give them the excuse to write that the FBI has the material or [REDACTED] and that we were keeping it very close-hold. He said he couldn\u2019t believe they hadn\u2019t gone with it. I said it was inflammatory stuff that they would get killed for reporting straight up from the source reports.\n\nIn his memoir, published earlier this week, Comey also claims that CNN was a factor in his decision to include the dossier claims in the classified briefing to Trump and another briefing to President Obama.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nStill, I could see no way out of it. The FBI was aware of the material. Two United States senators separately contacted me to alert me to its existence and the fact that many in Washington either had it or knew of it. CNN had informed the FBI press office that they were going to run with it as soon as the next day.\n\nThe news hook that CNN in part used to report on the dossier claims was actually the briefing on the matter by Comey, and a similar briefing to President Obama by administration officials.\n\nOn January 10, CNN was first to report the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to Obama and Trump.\n\nThe news network cited \u201cmultiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the briefings\u201d \u2013 in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings \u2013 revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia\u2019s alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe documents were given to the politicians during the briefings delivered by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers, the officials told CNN.\n\nThe network reported the documents state that \u201cRussian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump\u201d and contain \u201callegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.\u201d\n\nCNN reported how the briefings provided credibility to the dossier charges that were circulating among the news media for months but remained largely unreported:\n\nSome of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer. What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago.\n\nIt would later emerge that the dossier had been paid for by Trump\u2019s primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). It was produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm.\n\nJust after CNN\u2019s January 10 report on the classified briefings about the dossier, BuzzFeed infamously published the dossier\u2019s full unverified contents.\n\nThe New York Times used CNN\u2019s story to report some contents of the dossier the same day as CNN\u2019s January 10 report on the briefings.\n\nAfter citing the CNN story, the Times reported:\n\nThe memos describe sex videos involving prostitutes with Mr. Trump in a 2013 visit to a Moscow hotel. The videos were supposedly prepared as \u201ckompromat,\u201d or compromising material, with the possible goal of blackmailing Mr. Trump in the future. The memos also suggest that Russian officials proposed various lucrative deals, essentially as disguised bribes in order to win influence over Mr. Trump. The memos describe several purported meetings during the 2016 presidential campaign between Trump representatives and Russian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest, including the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.\n\nImmediately following CNN\u2019s article, National Intelligence Director Clapper added fuel to the media fire about the dossier by releasing a statementthat he spoke to Trump to express \u201cmy profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press\u201d \u2013 referring to the leaks to CNN about the classified briefing. He called the leaks \u201cextremely corrosive and damaging to our national security.\u201d\n\nClapper\u2019s statement generated fresh media coverage of the dossier briefing.\n\nPrior to CNN\u2019s report, which was picked up by news agencies worldwide, the contents of the dossier had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish.\n\nAll that changed when the dossier contents were presented to Obama and Trump during the classified briefings. In other words, the briefings themselves and the subsequent leak to CNN about those briefings by \u201cmultiple US officials with direct knowledge,\u201d seem to have given the news media the opening to report on the dossier\u2019s existence as well as allude to some of the document\u2019s unproven claims.\n\nIn an updated version of CNN\u2019s report, the network revealed that it had reviewed the 35-page dossier and would not report \u201con details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations.\u201d\n\nWhen it published the full dossier, BuzzFeed reported that the contents had circulated \u201cfor months\u201d and were known to journalists.\n\nThe website reported, \u201cThe documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them. Mother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column.\u201d\n\nIn his statement following the leaks to CNN about the dossier briefings to Obama and Trump, Clapper also said the dossier contents had been \u201cwidely circulated in recent months among the media, members of Congress and Congressional staff even before the IC became aware of it.\u201d\n\nIt seems the news media waited for the leak about the dossier briefings first reported by CNN before publicizing on the dossier\u2019s existence and some of its contents.\n\nYet Comey continues to claim the opposite was the case \u2013 that he conducted the briefings because of the possibility of news media coverage.\n\nIn his June 2016 prepared remarks before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June, Comey also made that claim when he detailedwhy the Intelligence Community briefed Obama and Trump on the \u201csalacious material\u201d \u2013 a clear reference to the dossier.\n\nComey wrote:\n\nThe IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\n\nComey is clearly painting a picture that he needed to brief Trump and Obama on the dossier claims because of supposedly imminent news media reports.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Paul Gosar (R-AZ) joined SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Thursday\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight to call on the Justice Department (DOJ) to lay perjury charges against James Comey and Andrew McCabe for allegedly lying under oath during testimonies before Congress.\n\nGosar discussed Republican lawmakers\u2019 sending of criminal referrals to Attorney General Jeff Sessions for a number of Obama administration officials (Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch) and senior FBI officials (James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and Peter Strzok) for crimes related to ostensible investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s felonious handling of classified information and of alleged \u201cRussian interference\u201d in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMansour noted that the DOJ\u2019s Office of the Inspector General referred McCabe to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia for criminal prosecution. It is unclear what charges were recommended. She asked Gosar if Republicans had yet received a response from the DOJ to their letter recommending criminal investigations of Comey, McCabe, and others.\n\nGosar said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten a response [from the DOJ] yet, but you\u2019re already starting to see, all of a sudden today, DOJ releases the seven Comey memos that we highlight inside the letter. There\u2019s a possibility that as early as tomorrow, we\u2019ll see the full unredacted aspects. People like McCabe, remember, was also an acting director of the FBI, so more impetus should be placed on what he held not just as deputy, but as acting director of the FBI, as well. They have to go to court. They have to be charged. They have to present their facts against juries of their peers. The same thing here is with Mr. Comey. Imagine that these memos, this guy was doing a secret journal, a diary, for the full intention of taking down a president. This shows every American the presence and the aptitude in which the deep state will go after anything to preserve themselves. We have to make people pay the penalty for violating the law. Trust is a series of promises kept. This is how you get back to regular order, is holding people accountable for the crimes against the people, against institutions, and against the rule of law. It has to happen.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nPollak asked Gosar if Comey should be charged with perjury if it is found that the former FBI director lied to Congress while under oath: \u201cWhat if Comey is suddenly found to have been lying, could that not cause him to be taken up on perjury charges?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he should be because if you go back into the record,\u201d Gosar began, then said, \u201cin regards to the Clinton email scandal, did he come up with a conclusion before or after the interviewing of the 17 key witnesses as well as Mrs. Clinton and her personal chief of staff and legal counsel? \u2026 We have that information, and when we start seeing the unredacted aspects, you\u2019ll find that Mr. Comey lied in that regard. That is highlighted, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s also referred in our letter to being charged with perjury. The web is cast wide and far because they went through every aspect. This was well-orchestrated.\u201d\n\nPollak asked Gosar about the possible future prosecution of McCabe for perjury. He asked, \u201c[McCabe] may be prosecuted for perjury now. That\u2019s in addition to the congressional referral. What\u2019s your reaction to that?\u201d\n\nGosar responded, \u201cI think it\u2019s high time. \u2026 His attorney actually scoffed at it, so I hope that he\u2019s prepared for the consequences because no leniency should be given, like he gave no leniency to Gen. Flynn.\u201d\n\nGosar continued, \u201cIt seems like the rats are all now starting to fall and starting to bite each other. They\u2019re all lying. What ends up happening is when you throw one rat under the bus, the rest of the rats follow. \u2026 Look at the attitudes of the actors.\u201d\n\nGosar said the Obama administration had weaponized federal agencies along partisan lines. He stated, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just the DOJ. This was all the agencies in the government. \u2026 When you see the weaponization of these agencies, especially the DOJ, which is supposed to be impartial, we\u2019ve got problems. But folks, this wasn\u2019t just the DOJ. This was all the agencies in the government, whether it be the EPA, the Interior. All of these agencies were being weaponized against the American people.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik."}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/WbxX8iETKxs/", "published": "2018-04-20T14:04:47", "title": "Plurality See Comey Book as 'Politically Motivated Attack' on Trump", "text": "A plurality of voters, a full 42 percent, believe that the book written by disgraced former FBI Director James Comey is a \u201cpolitically motivated attack on the president,\u201d according to a poll released by Rasmussen Reports.\n\nDespite glowing press coverage 24/7 over the last week, an anemic 40 percent believe Comey\u2019s book is an \u201caccurate portrayal of his dealings with Trump.\u201d Nineteen percent remain undecided.\n\nThis terrible number comes on the heels of a poll from earlier this week that showed a plurality of 46 percent want Comey prosecuted for leaking classified information.\n\nIn other words, a plurality of voters see Comey as a dishonest, partisan hack \u2014 which is the exact opposite of the image he and his media are desperately trying to craft. This is a massive failure, not only on Comey\u2019s part, but on the media\u2019s part. Since Trump fired him, both Comey and the media have been trying to shape him into a victim, into the last honest man in DC, into a selfless hero.\n\nWe the people are obviously too smart to buy that. We are also not all that interested in buying his book.\n\nRasmussen also reports that only 36 percent of those polled are even \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to read Comey\u2019s book, while 60 percent said they are unlikely to read it.\n\nWhile Comey\u2019s book is currently a number one seller on Amazon, there is anecdotal evidence it will flame out fast.\n\nComey\u2019s biggest problem with public perception is that he does not wear well. He is obviously a man who is writing himself into his own story as the hero. Overall, though, he comes off as sanctimonious and insecure, a small, awkward and petty man hiding in a tall man\u2019s body.\n\nHis book was supposed to contain the smoking gun proving Trump should be impeached, instead it is full of petty attacks on Trump\u2019s appearance, self-aggrandizing, and holier-than-thou sermonizing from lifelong bureaucrat who leaked classified information and promoted partisan snakes like Andrew McCabe, who is now in serious legal jeopardy.\n\nMoreover, Comey stupidly admitting that he re-opened the Clinton email investigation based on political considerations, based on his belief she would win the presidency and this was his way to remove a cloud over an incoming president\u2019s head, beggars belief. Worse still is the news that Comey informed Trump about the most embarrassing parts of the Russian dossier without informing him that the dossier was created by the Clinton campaign!\n\nIt is also becoming more and more clear that the only reason Comey even bothered to brief Trump on this unverified nonsense was to set the president up. Comey knew his briefing (the news of which was immediately leaked to CNN anti-Trump activist Jake Tapper \u2014 who was probably standing by in cahoots) would magically turn a phony memo into legitimate news. It was all a set-up to allow the far-left CNN to report on a dossier they had been dying to report on, which in turn allowed the far-left BuzzFeed to release the full contents of lies funded by Hillary Clinton.\n\nComey\u2019s biggest problem is that none of his so-called revelations back up his rhetoric. He undoubtedly hates President Trump, probably for firing him, but nothing he details in his book, his interviews, or even in those classified memos that were finally released to the public, justify his hatred or Robert Mueller\u2019s stupid investigation.\n\nThe public knows a witch hunt based on a nothingburger when they see one, and in Comey the public sees, not a man of integrity, but a petty bureaucrat with an inflated opinion of himself looking to get rich off of the media\u2019s abiding Trump hatred.\n\nComey will only be remembered as a footnote, and a ridiculous one at that.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

It has been slightly updated to reflect dates in 2018.\n\nOn Sunday, April 1, billions of Christians around the world celebrated Easter. But April 20, Friday, was a special day, too.\n\nDid you forget? Friday -- April 20th -- is Hitler's birthday! The Fuehrer would have been 129 years young!\n\nDidn't you celebrate?\n\nAs I explain in my book \"Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy,\" during Hitler's 12-year reign, people across Germany twisted themselves into veritable pretzels to praise the Fuhrer on his birthday! It was a day of national celebration.\n\nHow things change. Today, Hitler's name is synonymous with evil. What a spectacular reversal of fortune.\n\nHow is it that one man slunk to his death defeated and is today despised by the whole world, while another man went to his death with God's peace, and is today everywhere hailed as a hero?\n\nHitler's last birthday -- his 56th -- was already a grim harbinger of things to come. Ten days later he would commit suicide, so the mood in the bunker on his last \"Geburtstag\" was not exactly festive.\n\nHe was a shattered man, hiding like a rat beneath the shattered city that was to have been the capital of his new Germany. His die-hard bunker-mates held a small celebration for him, but Herr Hitler had to be sedated before he could make an appearance. Can anyone dream up a more depressing birthday party? What's the German word for \"bummer\"?\n\nContrast Hitler's bleak ending with that of another German of that era, Dietrich Bonhoeffer.\n\nBonhoeffer was a brilliant young pastor and a theologian, whose deep faith in God led him to get involved in the plot to kill Hitler. When Hitler learned of Bonhoeffer's involvement he flew into a typically violent rage. As one of his final acts of revenge -- just three weeks before he committed suicide -- Hitler condemned the young pastor to death. Bonhoeffer was hanged on April 9, 1945 at Flossenburg Concentration Camp.\n\nBut by all accounts, Bonhoeffer went to his death with the peace of God, with no regrets. How can that be?\n\nHe was 39-years-old, widely reckoned a theological genius. He had already written two of the classic books of the 20th century, \"The Cost of Discipleship\" and \"Life Together.\" He was engaged to be married to a wonderful young woman. He had such a terrifically bright future!\n\nBonhoeffer even had an opportunity to escape his fate.\n\nIn my book I tell the story of how he had fled to America, but then decided to return to Germany, to face the horrors that lay ahead with his people.\n\nWhy did he return when he didn't have to? And why didn't he have any regrets for doing so, even after he knew he would pay the ultimate price?\n\nJust before he died, Bonhoeffer told a fellow prisoner, \"This is the end. But for me, the beginning of life.\"\n\nHow is it that one man slunk to his death defeated and is today despised by the whole world, while another man went to his death with God's peace, and is today everywhere hailed as a hero, as one of the few Germans with the courage to see what was happening and to speak against it and act against it, even at the cost of his own life?\n\nThere's much to say by way of an answer, but since the Easter story is fresh in our minds, let's start there.\n\nBonhoeffer believed the Easter story. He actually believed the extraordinary story of God's coming to Earth and dying and then rising from the dead to defeat death forever. He believed that because if this was true, he need never fear death. All he needed to worry about was doing the right thing and trusting God with the results. And that he did.\n\nBecause Bonhoeffer believed these things he had the courage to do what almost no one else around him could do. He stood up for the Jews of Europe and today he is celebrated and cherished, while Hitler, who condemned him to death and who only believed in himself, is reviled as a monster.\n\nThat day in the bunker 73 years ago, as the drugged-up Fuehrer celebrated his last birthday, he was alive and Bonhoeffer had been dead for eleven days.\n\nBut on that day -- April 20, 1945 -- who was happy and who was at peace, Hitler or Bonhoeffer?\n\nFor that matter, which of them is happy and at peace today?\n\nIt's something chilling to think about, the contrast between these two Germans, between these two lives and these two deaths.\n\nBut at this poignant time of year, when Passover and Easter have just been celebrated by billions around the world, it's especially appropriate that we do think about it.\n\nDo those of us who say we believe in God really believe it? Because if we do, it will affect how we behave today, this week, this month...\n\nIf we believe in the word of God, as Bonhoeffer did, it will give us the courage do the right thing wherever we are. Like Bonhoeffer, we will do the right thing and trust God with the consequences.\n\nFaith and courage go together.\n\nBonhoeffer's faith gave him the courage to stand against the greatest evil of the 20th century. And today we celebrate him and revile the inhuman tyrant he stood against.\n\nSo at this glorious time of year, dare to think about what you really believe. What you believe about your faith will affect how you behave today and how people regard you years from today. That's a fact.\n\nLet the life of Bonhoeffer, lived in faith and without fear, be a source of encouragement to you, so that your life in turn may be a source of encouragement to others in years to come."}, {"link": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/04/20/north-korea-reportedly-assured-pompeo-that-release-3-detainees-could-be-joined-with-upcoming-summit.html", "published": "2018-04-21T02:15:00", "title": "North Korea reportedly assured Pompeo that release of 3 detainees could be joined with upcoming summit", "text": "In his meeting earlier this month with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, CIA Director Mike Pompeo was assured that a planned summit between Kim and President Trump could be joined with the release of three detained U.S. citizens, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday night.\n\nPompeo, whose nomination as secretary of state is pending, visited Pyongyang over Easter weekend.

Remember that Kim simply made a statement \u2013 and he has a long record of lying and breaking promises on the nuclear issue and other issues.\n\nWhile Kim\u2019s conciliatory words are certainly welcome, there\u2019s no way of knowing whether he will actually do what he claims.\n\nBefore we start singing \u201cGive Peace a Chance\u201d and celebrating a victory by the Trump administration for forcing Kim to back down, let\u2019s pause. Remember that Kim simply made a statement \u2013 and he has a long record of lying and breaking promises on the nuclear issue and other issues.\n\nAt this point, Kim has given away absolutely nothing. All he has to do is give an order and North Korea can resume testing nuclear weapons and missiles again.\n\nAnd of critical importance, Kim gave no indication he plans to destroy his small but devastating nuclear arsenal and missiles that he has already developed \u2013 or his large conventional armed forces and armaments. He already has the ability to kill millions of people with the nuclear weapons and missiles that he has on hand, without developing any new ones.\n\nKim may simply be trying to show signs that he is willing to make major concessions to have better relations with the United States, South Korea and Japan, along with the international community. He has plenty of reasons to be on his best behavior over the next few weeks, showing that he can be reasonable, rational and open to a long-term d\u00e9tente.\n\nThe North Korean leader will meet on Friday in the week ahead with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. And plans are underway for the first-ever meeting between U.S. and North Korean leaders in coming weeks.\n\nRemember the cold hard reality of what we witnessed back in 2017. Kim might not need to conduct many more missile or nuclear tests to know he can hit targets in the U.S. homeland.\n\nKim tested three intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) \u2013 part of a sprint of over 20 missile tests last year \u2013 that showed North Korea had the range and technological prowess to strike as far as New York City and even Washington, D.C.\n\nIn September, Kim also tested a hydrogen bomb \u2013 the most destructive of all nuclear weapons. One of these bombs could wipe any U.S. city off the map, with horrific casualties.\n\nSo Kim is now very close to having a fully capable, albeit tiny, nuclear force with global reach. All that is needed is the ability for his warheads to re-enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and land on target.\n\nAnd we know, at least according to one report, that Kim has at least a crude capability to see his warheads survive the massive heat and wind shears to rain down atomic terror on his enemies.\n\nSo what does this all mean?\n\nSince Kim last tested an ICBM \u2013 or any missile \u2013 in November, he has had months of lab research time to perfect even more of his nuclear weapons arsenal and missiles.\n\nKim may have gambled that announcing a closure of his atomic testing grounds and suspending missile and nuclear weapons tests will gain him tremendous international goodwill, a meeting with the U.S. president \u2013 and result in him losing nothing.\n\nKim could easily start to test missiles at any time he wishes. And he doesn\u2019t need missiles flying all throughout Northeast Asia to perfect the targeting, guidance, command and control and heatshield technology of his nuclear delivery systems in small ways.\n\nPerfecting all these things could have very big results months or years down the line if Kim decides to change his mind and begin missile testing again.\n\nThe same goes for nuclear weapons. Just because Kim closes his nuclear testing area doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t open it back up again. The testing site \u2013 a series of carefully crafted deep underground tunnels that took time to construct \u2013 is not a sophisticated lab. So let\u2019s not get carried away and be so impressed.\n\nAgain, as I noted just recently in a Fox News Opinion piece, what Kim is likely doing is setting the craftiest of traps \u2013 one designed to suck the Trump administration into months or years of negotiations.\n\nAll the while, Kim\u2019s scientists are working to perfect his deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction \u2013 not just nuclear weapons, but also chemical and likely biological weapons as well.\n\nThe Trump administration must move past Kim\u2019s dramatic announcement that was designed to pull at our emotions and make us hopeful that peace is at hand.\n\nWe must demand deeds, because as the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. Particularly in Kim\u2019s case.\n\nFor example, the Trump administration should insist on a roadmap whereby Kim lays out how he will get rid of his nuclear weapons for good \u2013 before any U.S.-North Korea summit.\n\nAny agreement with the North should be contingent on international inspectors having 24-hour access to all parts of North Korea \u2013 with no site off limits and no notification of access. If inspectors are not allowed to go anywhere, anytime in North Korea without notice there is no real basis for a deal.\n\nAlso, any lifting of the international maximum pressure campaign on North Korea must be contingent on Kim making measured and definable progress on giving up his nukes. He must give verifiable proof that he is getting rid of his atomic arsenal to see economic sanctions lifted.\n\nWhile I am hopeful that Kim could really be sincere in giving up his nukes, public declarations and easily reversed measures are meaningless. I can only hope the Trump administration sees it the same way."}, {"link": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/20/florida-high-school-shooting-leaves-one-student-injured-suspect-in-custody.html", "published": "2018-04-21T01:30:00", "title": "Florida high school shooting leaves one student injured; suspect in custody", "text": "A suspect was in custody following a shooting at a Florida high school Friday that injured one student, police said.\n\nThe Marion County Sheriff's Office said the incident occurred at Forest High School in Ocala.

Bush Library & Museum, one of the first signs they see is the name of the road that leads up to the building -- affectionately named Barbara Bush Drive.\n\nYou could ask anyone passing through those museum doors who paid their respects to the former First Lady what they admired about her, and there are two traits specifically that stand out: her passion for education and her love for her family.\n\nOne of many educators who paid their respects to Mrs. Bush at the museum was former teacher Barbara Roach, who honored Barbara Bush in a special way.\n\n\"She was a treasure to her family and our nation,\" said Roach, who taught for 37 years in San Antonio. \"I'm very thankful and so in her honor I'm wearing blue and pearls and I usually dont wear the pearls.\"\n\nAdria Hogan, also a former teacher, traveled from Virginia and reflected on Mrs. Bush's imprint on American education.\n\n\"She had a great interest in literacy, which is the foundation of knowledge, experience, and perspective,\" Hogan said. \"So, her interests were very important for all of us.\"\n\nRoach also said Mrs. Bush had an \"emphasis on literacy and we need it all the time. I have nieces and nephews who think reading is not important. And it is.\"\n\nThe former first lady certainly thought so. So much so that the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy has provided more than $110 million to create or expand family literacy programs in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia, according to the foundation. The foundation also did a study in 2014 that showed for preschoolers who completed one of their programs, there was a 70 percent decrease in the number of children at risk for developmental delays.\n\nBarbara Bush talked about the importance of literacy herself during a 1990 commencement speech to Wellesley College , encouraging graduates to believe in something larger than their self, to get involved in some of the big ideas of our time.\n\n\"I chose literacy because I honestly believe that if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society.\" - Barbara Bush\n\n\"I chose literacy because I honestly believe that if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society,\" she said.\n\nTerri Havens, who said Barbara Bush was a great friend, went with a group of friends to drop off a children's book in front of the museum in honor of the former first lady.\n\n\"Oh my gosh, she changed the whole entire country and importance of literacy,\" Havens said. \"Every single child deserves to be able to read and she made that her mantra to make sure that that happened.\"\n\nAn independent school district's head start program in College Station was even named after the former first lady: the Barbara Bush Parent Center. It was established in 1997 to meet the needs of parents in the community, focusing on activities for parents of children birth to 3 years old and holding interactive sessions each month for families, according to the schools website.\n\n\"Everyone knows who Barbara Bush is, she made her imprint on society,\" Kim Hodge, College Station Independent School District Early Head Start operations manager, said. \"Being able to carry on her legacy here with her namesake on the front of our building is just a real pleasure for us. I just want her family to know that as long as Early Head Start has anything to do with it, literacy will be promoted out of this center.\"\n\nAshlee Schoenvogel is a former elementary school teacher who took her daughter to the front of the George H.W. Bush Library & Museum to pay respects to Mrs. Bush with a bouquet of flowers. She also reflected on Mrs. Bush's legacy in U.S. education.\n\n\"It just means to always look for the best for the kids and always put the children first,\" Schoenvogel said. \"And for the kids that aren't fortunate enough, her funding helped all the children receive books. I was a former educator, so (I) understand the importance she had for oung children and she was definitely a family person, put her family first always-something I strive to do.\"\n\nWith all that Barbara Bush stood for in education, she was all about family. She said this in front of a room packed with graduating college students at that 1990 commencement speech.\n\n\"At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent,\" she said.\n\nThere's a reason there's a line of Bush leaders and for many, it starts with Barbara.\n\n\"Your success as a family...our success as a society depends not on what happens in the White House, but on what happens inside our house.\" - Barbara Bush\n\n\"She stood by her husband,\" Roach said. \"I'm sure it wasnt easy but they traveled all over the world and she left a great legacy with her family.\"\n\n\"She was all about her family and that's where all of American society starts, is in the home,\" Hogan said."}]}, "nbcnews": {"rss": "https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/top-stories/?rss=y&embedThumb=y&summary=y", "link": "", "articles": [{"link": "http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NJ-Housing-Security-Director-Fired-Corruption-Probe-New-Jersey-NJ-480426833.html", "published": "2018-04-21T00:11:42", "title": "I-Team: Towns Get Subpoenas Amid New Jersey Corruption Probe", "text": "After an I-Team report exposed that a security director for the North Bergen Housing Authority had what amounted to a no-show job, at least one town has ended its contracts with the man's animal control business.

Santini received additional pay to his $81,000 a year salary as security director for the housing authority.\n\nAdditional records show Santini has another job. Records obtained the I-Team revealed Santini is also working as a part time health inspector in Weehawken.\n\nAs for Santini\u2019s animal control contracts with multiple towns, some are now finding ways of canceling their agreements with Santini and his animal control business. Just yesterday, the Bayonne City Council agreed to end its $87,000 annual deal with Santini.\n\n\u201cHis contract will be terminated as of May 14th, 2018,\u201d said the Bayonne Corporation Counsel Jay Coffey to the Hudson County View.\n\nBut the Township of North Bergen, where Santini has close ties to Mayor Nicholas Sacco, still maintains its animal control contract for $160,000.00 per year.\n\nIn February, Mayor Sacco admitted to knowing Santini for years and told Jonathan Dienst that a little scrutiny never hurts.\n\n\"You are doing an investigation,\" he said to the I-Team. \"Housing authority is doing an investigation. Hopefully everything is settled fine. Again, authority has to do what it has to do.\u201d\n\nLouis Zayas, a lawyer for Santini has not returned our phone call.\n\nHowever, Zayas told the Hudson County View that Santini plans to sue the housing authority for wrongful termination.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's spokesman for the Southern District of New York is not commenting on the office's investigation.\n\nThe internal report on the corruption allegations being complied by Tabakin could be released as early as next week."}, {"link": "http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Cop-Shot-Execution-MS-13-Threat-Alert-Reward-New-York-480371663.html", "published": "2018-04-20T23:11:38", "title": "Multiple Agencies, Departments on High Alert After Dual Threats Call for Cop Execution in New York", "text": "Authorities on Long Island, as well as in the city, are on high alert after a pair of threats against cops, one of which called for the execution of a police officer \"like we do in El Salvador,\" believed to stem from a member of one of the globe's most notorious and violent gangs.

Sign up for our newsletter here.\n\nIn Comey Memos, Trump Talks of Jailed Journalists, \"Hookers\"\n\nIn a series of startlingly candid conversations, President Trump told former FBI Director James Comey that he had serious concerns about the judgment of a top adviser, asked about the possibility of jailing journalists and described a boast from Vladimir Putin about Russian prostitutes, according to Comey's notes of the talks obtained by The Associated Press. The 15 pages of documents contain new details about a series of interactions with Trump that Comey found so unnerving that he chose to document them in writing. Those seven encounters in the weeks and months before Comey's May 2017 firing include a Trump Tower discussion about allegations involving Trump and prostitutes in Moscow; a White House dinner at which Comey says Trump asked him for his loyalty; and a private Oval Office discussion where the ex-FBI head says the president asked him to end an investigation into Michael Flynn, the former White House national security adviser. The documents had been eagerly anticipated since their existence was first revealed last year, especially since Comey's interactions with Trump are a critical part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the president sought to obstruct justice. Trump fired back, tweeting the memos \"show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.\" The president added: \u201cWOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?\u201d\n\nGiuliani Joining Trump Legal Team in Special Counsel Russia Probe\n\nFormer NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump since the early days of his campaign, is joining the team of lawyers representing the president in the special counsel's Russia investigation. With the addition of Giuliani, Trump gains a former U.S. attorney, a past presidential candidate and a TV-savvy defender at a time when the White House is looking for ways to bring the president's involvement with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation to a close. The president has been weighing whether to sit for questioning by Mueller's team, and his legal team has repeatedly met with investigators to define the scope of the questions he would face. Giuliani will enter those negotiations, filling the void left by attorney John Dowd, who resigned last month. Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow told The Associated Press that Giuliani will be focusing on the Mueller investigation \u2014 not the legal matters raised by the ongoing investigation into Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nShooter Fires Through Restaurant Window, Kills 2 Deputies\n\nSomeone fired through the window of a north Florida restaurant, killing two deputies who were getting food, officials said. Gilchrist County Sheriff Bobby Schultz identified the slain deputies during a news conference as Sgt. Noel Ramirez, 30, and Deputy Taylor Lindsey, 25. The deputies were getting food at the Ace China restaurant in Trenton when the shooter walked up to the building and fired at them through a window, Schultz said. Fellow deputies responding to the scene found the shooter dead outside the business. Schultz wouldn't say how the suspect died, adding that state law enforcement officials were investigating. There's no apparent motive for the shooting. The shooter's name wasn't immediately released. Trenton is in northern Florida, about 35 miles west of Gainesville.\n\nLettuce-Linked E. Coli Outbreak Expands to 53 Cases in 16 States\n\nAn E. coli outbreak that health investigators believe is linked to chopped romaine lettuce has expanded, with 53 cases now reported in 16 states, and nearly three dozen hospitalized, at least five of whom suffered kidney failure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added 18 more cases to the total in its update Wednesday, a marked increase since the prior update less than a week earlier, and said five more states reported sick people: Alaska, Arizona, California, Louisiana and Montana. Officials believe the contaminated lettuce was grown in Yuma, Arizona, though they have not identified a grower, supplier, distributor or brand. Cases have been reported across the tri-state area, the most in New Pennsylvania has the most in this outbreak, followed by Idaho. The CDC added nine more hospitalizations to its count from last week, bringing the total in this outbreak to 31. Consumers who have bought romaine lettuce - including salads and salad mixes containing romaine lettuce - are advised to throw it away.\n\nAmericans Filling Far Fewer Opioid Prescriptions, New Data Show\n\nThe number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers filled in the U.S. fell dramatically last year, showing their biggest drop in 25 years and continuing a decline amid increasing legal restrictions and public awareness of the dangers of addiction, new data show. Health data firm IQVIA's Institute for Human Data Science released a report showing an 8.9 percent average drop nationwide in the number of prescriptions for opioids filled by retail and mail-order pharmacies. All 50 states and the District of Columbia had declines of more than 5 percent. Declines topped 10 percent in 18 states, including all of New England and other states hit hard by the opioid overdose epidemic, such as West Virginia and Pennsylvania. There was an even greater drop in total dosage of opioid prescriptions filled in 2017, down 12 percent from 2016. Reasons for that include more prescriptions being for a shorter duration, a 7.8 percent decline in new patients starting on opioid prescriptions and far fewer high-dose prescriptions.\n\nFiles Show Rising Alarm in Prince's Circle as Health Failed\n\nSome of Prince's closest confidants had grown increasingly alarmed about his health in the days before he died and tried to get him help as they realized he had an opioid addiction \u2014 yet none were able to give investigators the insight they needed to determine where the musician got the fentanyl that killed him, according to investigative documents. Just ahead of this weekend's two-year anniversary of Prince's death, prosecutors announced they would file no criminal charges in the case and the state investigation was closed. Carver County Attorney Mark Metz said Prince had suffered from pain for years and likely believed he was taking a common painkiller. Prince was 57 when he was found alone and unresponsive in an elevator at his Paisley Park studio compound on April 21, 2016. His death sparked a national outpouring of grief and prompted a joint investigation by Carver County and federal authorities."}]}, "washingtonpost": {"rss": "http://washingtonpost.com/rss/politics", "link": "", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-told-white-house-that-rosensteins-firing-could-prompt-his-departure-too/2018/04/20/911ca994-44c7-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html", "published": null, "title": "Sessions told White House that Rosenstein\u2019s firing could prompt his departure, too", "text": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently told the White House he might have to leave his job if President Trump fired his deputy, Rod J.

While Trump also has railed against Sessions at times, the protest resignation of an attorney general \u2014 which would be likely to incite other departures within the administration \u2014 would create a moment of profound crisis for the White House.\n\nIn the phone call with McGahn, Sessions wanted details of a meeting Trump and Rosenstein held at the White House on April 12, according to a person with knowledge of the call. Sessions expressed relief to learn that their meeting was largely cordial. Sessions said he would have had to consider leaving as the attorney general had Trump ousted Rosenstein, this person said.\n\nAnother person familiar with the exchange said Sessions did not intend to threaten the White House but rather wanted to convey the untenable position that Rosenstein\u2019s firing would put him in.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nRosenstein\u2019s status remains uncertain, but the pressure he is facing seemed to subside after last week.\n\nLast summer, when it appeared Trump was going to fire Sessions or pressure him to resign, Republican lawmakers and conservative advocacy groups rallied to Sessions\u2019s side and warned the president not to move against him.\n\nTrump had told senior officials last week that he was considering firing Rosenstein, who was confirmed by the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support last year. Since then, alumni of the Justice Department have rallied to Rosenstein\u2019s defense.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, more than 800 former Justice Department employees had signed an open letter calling on Congress to \u201cswiftly and forcefully respond to protect the founding principles of our Republic and the rule of law\u201d if Trump were to fire the deputy attorney general, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III or other senior Justice Department officials. The group MoveOn.org has sought to organize nationwide protests if such an event were to occur.\n\n[Bannon pitches White House on plan to cripple Mueller probe, protect Trump]\n\nRosenstein, on behalf of the Justice Department, is set to argue a sentencing case, Chavez-Meza v. United States, before the Supreme Court on Monday. Appearing before the high court has long been a professional goal, people close to Rosenstein say.\n\nA senior administration official said Sessions does not like the way Rosenstein has been treated by the president and had expressed such concerns for months. He has regularly sought guidance from the White House about Rosenstein\u2019s standing with the president and asked about his interactions with Trump, this official said.\n\nBut Sessions has had little ability to do anything about it, given his own shaky standing with Trump for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, this official said. Trump has, at times, referred to Sessions as \u201cMr. Magoo\u201d and Rosenstein as \u201cMr. Peepers,\u201d a character from a 1950s sitcom, according to people with whom the president has spoken.\n\nThe relationship between Sessions and Rosenstein \u2014 and their staffs \u2014 has been strained at times over the first year of the Trump administration. But people familiar with Sessions\u2019s thinking say that he has said several times that he would find it difficult to remain as attorney general if Trump fired for no good reason the veteran prosecutor in Baltimore whom Sessions chose to be his deputy. The two men, along with Solicitor General Noel Francisco, were spotted in February dining together at a restaurant near the Justice Department, generating some speculation that they were attempting a display of solidarity.\n\nRosenstein, the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 official, is tasked with running the day-to-day operations of the sprawling agency of 113,000 employees who work for the FBI; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Bureau of Prisons; U.S. attorneys offices; and Main Justice, the agency\u2019s headquarters. But from the time he was confirmed in May of last year, the investigation into possible coordination during the 2016 presidential campaign between Trump associates and agents of the Russian government has overshadowed everything he has done.\n\nJames M. Trusty, a partner at Ifrah Law and a friend of Rosenstein\u2019s, said the deputy attorney general \u201cwent into the job with a pretty fatalistic view,\u201d but he \u201cprobably didn\u2019t know it was going to be this much of a storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember him joking at his going-away party that nine months was the average tenure for the deputy attorney general,\u201d Trusty said.\n\nA wall of photographs outside Rosenstein\u2019s fourth-floor office at the Justice Department illustrates the high-stress and political nature of the deputy attorney general\u2019s position. President Barack Obama\u2019s first deputy attorney general, David Ogden, stepped down from the job after less than a year. One of President Bill Clinton\u2019s deputy attorneys general, Philip B. Heymann, lasted 10 months.\n\nTrusty, who said he had spoken with Rosenstein about three weeks ago, said Rosenstein had kept his views on the situation largely private and had not sought surrogates or anyone else to press his case.\n\n\u201cI think he tends to view things in a very long-range way, kind of a this-too-shall-pass philosophy about the slings and arrows that will come at you,\u201d Trusty said.\n\nA month after Rosenstein became deputy attorney general, he was criticized for his role in the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey. Rosenstein wrote a critical memo lambasting Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, and the White House later used the document as a pretext to remove the FBI director. After a few days, though, Trump said he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey. Comey has said in recent days he believed Rosenstein \u201cacted dishonorably\u201d and could not be trusted.\n\nAt that point, Rosenstein was overseeing the Russia investigation because Sessions had recused himself. On May 17, about a week after the Comey firing, Rosenstein announced that he had appointed Mueller as special counsel to conduct the Russia investigation.\n\nRosenstein took the action without first consulting Sessions and notified him when he was at the White House meeting with Trump. The decision took Trump by surprise and greatly angered him.\n\nA person close to the White House and the Justice Department said Sessions has \u201cvacillated, I think, from being concerned about the deputy leaving or being fired and recognizing that Rosenstein has not been a friend of either him or the department.\u201d\n\nDuring the past year, Rosenstein has been involved in several policy issues in the Justice Department, as well as complex prosecutions involving cybercrimes and the first charges against Chinese-based fentanyl manufacturers and distributors.\n\nBut Russia continues to consume his days. This week, two of Trump\u2019s top legislative allies and leading members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus met with Rosenstein and pressed him for more documents about the conduct of law enforcement officials involved in the Russia probe. They warned him that he could face impeachment proceedings or an effort to hold him in contempt of Congress if he did not satisfy Republican demands for more documents.\n\nRobert Barnes contributed to this report."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/04/20/wealthy-donors-spend-millions-to-boost-top-super-pac-supporting-senate-democrats-filings-show/", "published": null, "title": "Wealthy donors spend millions to boost top super PAC supporting Senate Democrats, filings show", "text": "\n\nU.S. Sen.

Eric Greitens, already facing a felony invasion-of-privacy charge related to blindfolding and taking a photo of a woman, was charged Friday with two felony counts of computer tampering.\n\nThe new charge stems from investigations by the state attorney general and the St. Louis circuit attorney into claims that Greitens used the donor list of a veterans charity to raise funds for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign without the organization\u2019s knowledge or consent.\n\nOn Tuesday, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley said he was turning over evidence to the circuit attorney ahead of a pending statute of limitations deadline this Sunday.\n\nThe governor, as he has after every accusation, came out swinging. He accused the circuit attorney of wasting taxpayer money and indicated he\u2019d go to trial.\n\n\u201cI will have my day in court. I will clear my name. This prosecutor can come after me with everything she\u2019s got, but as all faithful people know: In time comes the truth. And the time for truth is coming,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nGreitens accused Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner of bringing the charges because the original case against him was falling apart. Last week, a special state House committee released a report about the incident that led to that case in which a woman accused him of unwanted sexual contact. The woman, Greitens\u2019s former hairdresser, said that in 2015, before his gubernatorial run, he groped her and slapped her. She also said in testimony that Greitens blindfolded her and taped her hands to exercise equipment and then took a photo of her and that she felt \u201ccoerced, maybe,\u201d to perform oral sex on him.\n\nGreitens has admitted to an extramarital affair but denied wrongdoing. A trial in that case is scheduled for May 14.\n\nAccording to documents filed Friday by Gardner\u2019s office, a source within the nonprofit the Mission Continues admitted to helping a \u201cpolitical fundraiser working on behalf of Greitens for Missouri\u201d transmit the donor list \u201cat the direction of the defendant\u201d in violation of Missouri law and the charity\u2019s internal policies. Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, established the organization in 2007 to help veterans reintegrate through community service after returning from war. He left it in 2014, a year before announcing his candidacy for the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWe believe the evidence we have will support a finding of probable cause that the governor obtained the list, transmitted the list, used the list without the permission of the Mission Continues, and that he did so for political fundraising purposes,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThat is a finding that would support prosecution in this case.\u201d\n\nThe charges Friday add a new layer of trouble for the embattled governor. A Bronze Star recipient and former Rhodes Scholar, Greitens beat the incumbent state attorney by six percentage points in 2016 and was quickly hailed as a rising star in the Republican Party within and beyond his state. But his pugilistic outsider stance quickly soured in Jefferson City, and he has found himself with few allies as his troubles have mounted.\n\nEvery senior Republican officeholder in the state and Greitens\u2019s top private donor called immediately for him to resign. A resolution to impeach sits on the Speaker\u2019s desk awaiting action.

Boehner (R-Ohio) was praised for pivoting from being \u201cunalterably opposed\u201d to decriminalizing marijuana while in Congress to now joining a board of directors for a cannabis company focused on rolling back federal regulations.\n\nBut the reception that the white, Republican male received for his shift in views is quite different from how other Americans have been treated in regard to the drug. And some Democratic lawmakers took note.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted earlier this week:\n\n\u201cMore than 2 million in jail, mostly black and brown, many for holding a small amount of marijuana. The drug war is a fiscal and moral failure but before moving on, we must stop imprisoning people of color for something that is effectively no longer illegal in fancy towns.\u201d\n\nAccording to Quartz, nearly half a million people were arrested for selling weed while Boehner was speaker from 2011 to 2015. But now Boehner thinks decriminalizing the drug is helpful in assisting veterans, especially in the midst of an opioid epidemic.\n\nI\u2019m joining the board of #AcreageHoldings because my thinking on cannabis has evolved. I\u2019m convinced de-scheduling the drug is needed so we can do research, help our veterans, and reverse the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities. @AcreageCannabis https://t.co/f5i9KcQD0W \u2014 John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) April 11, 2018\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced Friday that he was also changing his stance on marijuana. He said that his bill to decriminalize it will \u201cinject real dollars into minority and women-owned businesses to ensure those disproportionately affected by marijuana criminalization can benefit from this new economy.\u201d\n\nAttitudes have obviously evolved on marijuana on a national level. Washington, D.C., and nine states have legalized recreational use of the drug. And many others allow some sort of medical use. Legal marijuana sales exceeded $9 billion in 2017, according to an industry estimate.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported that polls show that more than 60 percent of Americans favor legalizing marijuana completely and more than 90 percent are in favor of legal medical use.\n\nBut not all Americans have benefited from this shift in attitude. Some are still dealing with the consequences of strict drug laws.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillbrand (D-N.Y.) noted the disparity in how marijuana laws affect people of color, as well as low-income people.\n\n\u201cBlack and Latino people in NYC are arrested at TEN times the rate of white people for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage. Along with Cory Booker and Sen. Sanders, I\u2019m cosponsoring a bill to legalize and decriminalize marijuana. Raise your voices and join us in this fight,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nA Drug Policy Alliance report showed that arrests for offenses such as possession under the age of 21, public consumption and other still-illegal actions related to marijuana are higher for black people. Vox reported that several studies have found that even in places where pot is legal, black people are still more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses compared to white people.\n\nIn Colorado, according to a 2016 public safety report, the marijuana arrest rate for whites and Hispanics is comparable, but the marijuana arrest rate for African Americans is almost three times that of whites.\n\nThe relationship between the disproportionately high incarceration rate of black people and the role race plays in this country's history with drug decriminalization is likely to continue to be a conversation as Americans revisit U.S. drug laws. How the opioid epidemic has ravaged rural, mostly white areas has captured national attention. But how people of color in urban areas have been treated by this country's drug laws appears to be a lesser concern right now.\n\nVincent M. Southerland, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality and the Law at New York University, wrote in the New York Times:\n\n\u201cToo many people have been deported, made homeless, lost financial aid, levied fines and fees or had their children taken away from them because of marijuana arrests.\n\n\u201cWhite entrepreneurs in the marijuana industry, and the lawmakers who help it flourish, should highlight the racist history of marijuana prohibition and acknowledge its continuing impact.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/20/whats-up-with-politicians-suddenly-embracing-pot/", "published": null, "title": "What\u2019s up with politicians suddenly embracing pot?", "text": "\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIt\u2019s not just because it\u2019s 4/20 \u2014 although that contributed to at least one important senator\u2019s announcement that he has come around to the idea of decriminalizing marijuana.\n\nMarijuana legalization advocates say they\u2019ve had the best week in Washington since \u2014 well, ever. And it\u2019s thanks to politicians on both sides, including the president, suddenly embracing efforts to help more states legalize marijuana.\n\n\u201cI think we reached critical mass among the population years ago,\u201d said Don Murphy, the director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, \u201cbut I think we are finally reaching critical mass on Capitol Hill now.\u201d\n\nConsider:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced Friday that he has decided to support decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level and will advocate bills to help marijuana businesses grow (no pun intended). Schumer cited an \u201cevolved thinking \u2014 both personally and by the nation\u201d for his switch. As The Washington Post\u2019s David Weigel writes, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that a leader of either party in Congress has endorsed a rollback of one of the country\u2019s oldest drug laws.\u201d\n\nThe Friday before, President Trump promised a Senate Republican from Colorado that he would protect states that have legalized marijuana. That\u2019s in stark contrast to what Trump\u2019s attorney general did earlier this year by rolling back Obama-era protections allowing states to create their own marijuana laws without fear of prosecution from the federal government. (The federal government says marijuana is illegal.) Trump\u2019s position on reconciling the different laws was vague before this.\n\nThis week, the House of Representatives held one of its first hearings ever on legislation to roll back medical marijuana regulations.\n\nAnd last week, former Republican House speaker John A. Boehner pulled a stunning 180 from his days in Congress and announced that he had joined the board of directors of a cannabis company. Boehner had once said he was \u201cunalterably opposed\u201d to decriminalizing marijuana because it would lead to more people abusing it, alcohol and other drugs.\n\nI\u2019m joining the board of #AcreageHoldings because my thinking on cannabis has evolved.

But there is plenty of evidence of states and public opinion moving, rather rapidly, in favor of marijuana legalization, and perhaps the politicians in Washington are taking notice.\n\nAll but two states have laws on the books at least recognizing the value of medical marijuana. Medical marijuana is legal in 29 states. Recreational marijuana is legal in nine states and the District, and advocates are optimistic that the number could double by the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAn October Gallup poll found record-high support for legalizing marijuana, including among Republicans:\n\n\u201cThe politics of it are making more sense every day,\u201d Murphy said, \u201ceven among Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, Republican lawmakers are considering legalizing recreational marijuana rather than letting an initiative that\u2019s gaining steam make the ballot this fall. GOP lawmakers fear that the ballot measure would boost Democratic turnout in November, reports the Detroit News. That would make Michigan only the second state where marijuana has been legalized by the legislature, after Vermont did so earlier this year. That bill was signed by a Republican governor, Phil Scott.\n\nIn the fall, voters in Oklahoma and Utah will consider marijuana measures. In 2016, voters in Arkansas, North Dakota and Florida overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana legalization. Those are all states Trump won.\n\nIt\u2019s probably less of a surprise that Democratic gubernatorial and attorney general candidates are practically tripping over themselves to support marijuana legalization, said Karen O\u2019Keefe of the Marijuana Policy Project.\n\nIn Schumer\u2019s home state of New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) is facing a primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, who has made marijuana legalization a central feature of her campaign. Cuomo initiated a statewide study this year on what legalizing marijuana would mean for New York.\n\nOf course, not everyone in Washington suddenly wants to see pot legalized everywhere. On Friday, to counter the 4/20 programming, Smart Approaches to Marijuana held a news conference in downtown D.C. to reiterate its opposition to marijuana legalization. The group\u2019s director, Kevin Sabet, said SAM would be ramping up its federal lobbying efforts and will soon call on support from families suffering from the national opioid crisis, \u201c80 percent of whom will tell you marijuana had a role to play.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, said Sabet and Rafael Lemaitre, a former spokesman for the Obama White House drug office, is that a nascent marijuana industry has poured millions of dollars into lobbying.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take it for granted anymore\u201d that politicians will reject marijuana legalization, Sabet said in an interview with The Fix, \u201cbut we also don\u2019t think it's inevitable.\u201d\n\nBut opponents appear to be fighting a losing battle at the moment. Election-year politics can never be entirely separated from politicians\u2019 decisions. It\u2019s possible Schumer is watching what\u2019s happening in his home state and the overwhelming support for legalization within his own party, and decided that backing marijuana could boost the chances of Democrats taking back control of the Senate in November.\n\nWhatever the reason, O\u2019Keefe said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing politicians\u2019 evolution on this issue quickly.\u201d\n\nSo quickly, apparently, that even glacial-paced Washington is starting to take notice."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/cia-declassifies-memo-clearing-haspel-of-responsibility-for-destroying-evidence/2018/04/20/a79e9bfc-44de-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html", "published": null, "title": "CIA declassifies memo clearing Haspel of responsibility for destroying evidence", "text": "The Central Intelligence Agency took the unusual step Friday of declassifying and releasing a memo clearing Gina Haspel of any wrongdoing in drafting an order to destroy videotaped evidence of brutal interrogation techniques, a move that comes as part of a greater campaign to rehabilitate her image and shore up congressional support for her bid to become the agency\u2019s director.\n\nThe memo, which former CIA deputy director Michael Morell wrote in 2011, is the result of a disciplinary review in which he \u201cfound no fault with the performance of Ms. Haspel\u201d \u2014 primarily because she drafted the cable \u201con the direct orders\u201d of her superior and did not release it herself.\n\n\u201cIt was not her decision to destroy the tapes,\u201d Morell wrote in the declassified document, which the CIA released Friday in response to requests from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nBut senators clamoring for the CIA to declassify documents related to Haspel\u2019s record on techniques often referred to as torture and the order to destroy evidence were angered by what they saw as a \u201cselective\u201d response to their demands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable for the CIA to declassify only material that\u2019s favorable to Gina Haspel, while at the same time stonewalling our efforts to declassify all documents related her involvement in the torture program,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a statement, responding to the release of the redacted memorandum. \u201cThe CIA has not been forthcoming . . . senators and the public need to know more about her record.\u201d\n\nWidespread concern about Haspel\u2019s role in the CIA\u2019s interrogation program has caused senators from both parties to question her record and her fitness to serve as the agency\u2019s director. With Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) already formally committed to opposing her nomination and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) \u2014 who has grilled Haspel for answers about her record \u2014 away from Washington receiving treatment for brain cancer, Haspel must secure the support of at least one Senate Democrat to clinch the nomination. So far, none have stepped forward.\n\nHaspel faces a confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 9 \u2014 and her performance during that grilling may be critical to determining whether she can be confirmed. The release of the memo is part of a broader public relations campaign that has begun in advance of that hearing \u2014 and that has made some CIA veterans uncomfortable.\n\nOne former official said the timing reveals the extent to which the CIA \u2014 notorious for withholding records from the public \u2014 can operate when it serves the agency\u2019s political interests.\n\n\u201cThe timing of its release devalues this document,\u201d said the former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. \u201cSince it\u2019s coming out now it . . . looks like its being released in a self-interested effort to help one of their own ascend to the directorship.\u201d\n\nThe memo states that Haspel \u201cacted appropriately\u201d in following instructions to draft the memo, Morell found, noting that even if \u201cthere is no \u2018good soldier\u2019 defense\u201d at the CIA, the Justice Department had investigated the cable and decided not to file charges.\n\nThat defense is unlikely to fully satisfy senators questioning not only Haspel\u2019s record, but whether she personally supported the use of enhanced interrogation techniques and the destruction of the videotapes. Several accounts have stated she did.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Morell report is highly incomplete, raising far more questions about Ms. Haspel than it answers,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement, adding: \u201cMy concerns about Ms. Haspel are far broader than this episode or anything else that has appeared in the press.\u201d\n\nThe Morell memo does not weigh in on questions about Haspel\u2019s involvement in the use of brutal interrogation methods at a black-site facility she supervised in Thailand. The memo does suggest, however, that there was general CIA support for the destruction of the tapes at the time Haspel drafted the 2005 memo, as officials were still heavily influenced by the experience of fallout from the 2004 scandal involving the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.\n\nMorell\u2019s review found that Haspel\u2019s superior at the CIA who ordered her to draft the cable, then-director of the National Clandestine Service, Jose Rodriguez, was worried the tapes would leak or be released, endangering the agents depicted on them and potentially damaging the CIA\u2019s reputation and \u201csignificantly degrading our operations capabilities.\u201d\n\nRodriguez was issued a letter of reprimand for his actions, because, as Morell wrote, he issued the cable ordering the destruction of the tapes without the direct approval of his superior, then-Director Porter Goss. He received no further punishment, because Morell determined Rodriguez did what he perceived to be in the interest of CIA agents and believed his actions were legal.\n\nGreg Miller contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-party-files-lawsuit-alleging-russia-the-trump-campaign-and-wikileaks-conspired-to-disrupt-the-2016-campaign/2018/04/20/befe8364-4418-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html", "published": null, "title": "Democratic Party sues Russia, Trump campaign and WikiLeaks alleging 2016 campaign conspiracy", "text": "The Democratic National Committee filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit Friday against the Russian government, the Trump campaign and the WikiLeaks organization alleging a far-reaching conspiracy to disrupt the 2016 campaign and tilt the election to Donald Trump.\n\nThe complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that top Trump campaign officials conspired with the Russian government and its military spy agency to hurt Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and help Trump by hacking the computer networks of the Democratic Party and disseminating stolen material found there.\n\n\u201cDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Russia launched an all-out assault on our democracy, and it found a willing and active partner in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign,\u201d DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis constituted an act of unprecedented treachery: the campaign of a nominee for President of the United States in league with a hostile foreign power to bolster its own chance to win the presidency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe suit asserts that the Russian hacking campaign \u2014 combined with Trump associates\u2019 contacts with Russia and the campaign\u2019s public cheerleading of the hacks \u2014 amounted to an illegal conspiracy to interfere in the election and caused serious damage to the Democratic Party.\n\n[Read the DNC lawsuit against Russia and the Trump campaign]\n\nSenate investigators and prosecutors for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III are still looking into whether Trump associates coordinated with any Russian efforts. Last month, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee said they had found no evidence that President Trump and his affiliates colluded with Russian officials to sway the election or that the Kremlin sought to help Trump \u2014 a conclusion rejected by the panel\u2019s Democrats.\n\nIn a statement, Trump Campaign Manager Brad Parscale said the Democrats\u2019 lawsuit was without merit and likely to be dismissed.\n\n\u201cThis is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Democrats\u2019 conspiracy theories against the President\u2019s campaign evaporating as quickly as the failing DNC\u2019s fundraising, they\u2019ve sunk to a new low to raise money, especially among small donors who have abandoned them.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit echoes a similar legal tactic that the Democratic Party used during the Watergate scandal. In 1972, the DNC sued President Richard Nixon\u2019s reelection committee seeking $1 million in damages for the break-in at Democratic headquarters in the Watergate building.\n\nThe suit was denounced at the time by Nixon\u2019s attorney general, John Mitchell, who called it a case of \u201csheer demagoguery\u201d by the DNC. But the civil action brought by the DNC\u2019s chairman, Lawrence F. O\u2019Brien, was successful, yielding a $750,000 settlement from the Nixon campaign that was reached on the day in 1974 that he left office.\n\nNick Akerman, a former Watergate prosecutor who specializes in computer-fraud cases, said he thought the Democrats\u2019 suit had merit and, despite predictions from Trump-allied lawyers, was unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThere is no way it\u2019s going to be dismissed,\u201d said Akerman, a partner in the New York office of the Dorsey & Whitney law firm. \u201cAt least not on the computer-fraud part of the case, which is really the heart of it. The Democrats have every right to bring this suit as they are aggrieved. My question is: What took them so long?\u201d\n\nIf allowed to proceed, the lawsuit would give the Democrats a chance to seek internal documents and testimony from the Trump campaign to help them learn more about interactions with Russia during the race.\n\nParscale noted that the Trump campaign, too, would be allowed to conduct discovery. He promised that the campaign would use the process to probe management decisions at the DNC, as well as the party\u2019s involvement with commissioning the Trump dossier, a research document produced by a former British spy that alleged the Trump campaign conspired with Russia. Late Friday, Trump made a similar point, tweeting that the suit provided \u201cgood news in that we will now counter\u201d for information from the Democrats including information from the party\u2019s servers about a range of topics including Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nSuing a foreign country may present legal challenges for the Democrats, in part because other nations have immunity from most U.S. lawsuits.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that Russia is not entitled to sovereign immunity in this case because \u201cthe DNC claims arise out of Russia\u2019s trespass on to the DNC\u2019s private servers . . . in order to steal trade secrets and commit economic espionage.\u201d\n\nThe suit seeks millions of dollars in compensation to offset damage it claims the party suffered from the hacks. The DNC argues that the cyberattack undermined its ability to communicate with voters, collect donations and operate effectively as its employees faced personal harassment and, in some cases, death threats.\n\nThe suit also seeks an acknowledgment from the defendants that they conspired to infiltrate the Democrats\u2019 computers, steal information and disseminate it to influence the election.\n\nTo support its case, the lawsuit offers a detailed narrative of the DNC hacks, as well as episodes in which key Trump aides are alleged to have been told Russia held damaging information about Clinton.\n\n[Inside Trump\u2019s financial ties to Russia and his unusual flattery of Vladimir Putin]\n\nRussia engaged in a \u201cbrazen attack on U.S. soil\u201d the party alleges, a campaign that began with the hack of its computer networks in 2015 and 2016. Trump campaign officials received repeated outreach from Russia, the suit says.\n\n\u201cRather than report these repeated messages and communications that Russia intended to interfere in the U.S. election, the Trump campaign and its agents gleefully welcomed Russia\u2019s help,\u201d the party argues.\n\nUltimately, Trump\u2019s associates entered into an agreement with Russian agents \u201cto promote Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy through illegal means,\u201d the suit concludes.\n\nIt does not name Trump as a defendant. Instead, it targets aides who, during the campaign, met with people believed to be affiliated with Russia. The aides targeted include the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Manafort\u2019s deputy during the campaign, Rick Gates.\n\nManafort and Gates were charged with money laundering, fraud and tax evasion in a case brought by special prosecutors last year. In February, Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI and is cooperating with investigators. Manafort has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe DNC lawsuit also names as a defendant the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU, which has been accused by the U.S. government of orchestrating the hacks, as well as WikiLeaks, which published emails stolen from the DNC, and the group\u2019s founder, Julian Assange.\n\nRepresentatives for a number of the defendants named in the lawsuit, including the Russian Embassy, WikiLeaks and Assange, did not respond to requests for comment Friday. A Manafort spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe lawsuit was also filed against Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant who claimed during the campaign that he was in contact with Assange.\n\n[Roger Stone claimed contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016, according to two associates]\n\nThe Trump advisers and associates have denied assisting Russia in a hacking campaign. Stone has denied any communication with Assange or advance knowledge of the document dumps by WikiLeaks, saying his comments about Assange were jokes or exaggerations.\n\nIn an email, Stone rejected the suit as \u201ca left-wing conspiracy theory dressed up as a law-suit.\u201d\n\nA few prominent Democrats also criticized the legal action.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted late Friday that the filing was \u201cspectacularly ill-timed\u201d and could abet the White House strategy of portraying Mueller\u2019s criminal probe as partisan. \u201cEveryone should chill out and let Mueller do his job,\u201d Axelrod wrote.\n\nThe DNC argues that the Russian government and the GRU\u2019s secret intrusion into the Democrats\u2019 computer systems violated laws that include those protecting trade secrets, prohibiting wire tapping and preventing trespassing.\n\nThe party said the Trump defendants committed conspiracy through their interaction with Russian agents and their public encouragement of the hacking, with the campaign acting as a racketeering enterprise promoting illegal activity.\n\nThe complaint was filed on behalf of the party by the law firm of Cohen Milstein.\n\nThe suit contains previously undisclosed details, including the specific date when it is believed the Russians breached the DNC computer system: July 27, 2015, according to forensic evidence cited in the filing.\n\nThe analysis shows the system was breached again on April 18, 2016. The first signs that hackers were siphoning documents and information from DNC systems were spotted on April 22. The suit notes that four days later, on April 26, Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was informed by Josef Mifsud, a London-based professor, that the Russians were in possession of thousands of emails that could be damaging to Clinton.\n\n[Top campaign officials knew of Trump adviser\u2019s outreach to Russia]\n\nThe defendants in the suit include Papadopoulos and Mifsud, as well as Aras and Emin Agalarov, the wealthy Russian father and son who hosted the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow in 2013. Trump, who owned the pageant, attended the event.\n\nThe Agalarovs played a role in arranging a meeting for a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York in 2016, at which Donald Trump Jr. had expected to be given damaging information about Clinton.\n\nScott Balber, an attorney for the Agalarovs, said the allegations about his clients were \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201ca publicity stunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had absolutely nothing to do with any alleged hacking of any Democratic computer system or any interference in the U.S. election,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyers for Papadopoulos declined to comment, citing their client\u2019s ongoing cooperation with the special counsel.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that when all the facts are known, the plaintiff will voluntarily dismiss Mr. Papadopoulos from the complaint,\u201d said the lawyers, Thomas Breen and Robert Stanley, in a written statement.\n\nThe lawsuit also describes how the Soviet Union paid for Trump to travel to Moscow in the 1980s and alleges that his personal and professional ties to Russia helped foster the conspiracy.\n\nThe DNC\u2019s lawyers wrote that \u201clong standing personal professional and financial ties to Russia and numerous individuals linked to the Russian government provided fertile ground for a conspiracy between the defendants to interfere in the 2016 elections.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also details the history of Manafort and Gates, who worked for Russia-friendly factions in Ukraine before joining the Trump campaign. Prosecutors have said Manafort and Gates were in contact in 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former linguist in the Russian army whom the FBI has alleged had ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/04/20/john-bolton-begins-to-shape-national-security-council-staff/", "published": null, "title": "John Bolton begins to shape National Security Council staff", "text": "\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton listens as President Trump speaks about Syria in the White House on Friday.

He cast the move as an appropriate appetizer for the banquet of denuclearization talks to follow.\n\n\u201cThey have my blessing,\u201d Trump, the self-proclaimed master dealmaker, declared. Later at a news conference with Abe, who remains wary of the sudden thaw in relations, Trump described his upcoming encounter with Kim as \u201ca historic moment and possibly beyond that, if it works out properly.\u201d\n\nWhat has emerged in recent days is that Trump the president, who has elevated North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat to his top foreign policy priority, is facing increasing pressure to deliver tangible results from his high-risk gambit, while Trump the showman, who is obsessed with ratings and scorecards, continues to elevate the bar of what is possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from uncertainty about whether this summit will happen to greatly heightened expectations,\u201d said Victor Cha, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served as a senior National Security Council official under President George W. Bush. \u201cHe\u2019s done it himself. We\u2019ve gone from, \u2018Maybe this will happen,\u2019 to all of a sudden talking about a peace treaty and normalization of relations.\u201d\n\nIn many regards, a first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader is perfectly suited to the ego of Trump, who thrilled supporters during the Republican National Convention in July 2016 when he declared, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d\n\nLate Friday, just days before a summit next week between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, North Korea\u2019s state news agency announced that Kim had suspended nuclear and ballistic missile tests and ordered a nuclear testing site to be shut down. The move was viewed as another sign that Kim, who last month visited Beijing in his first visit outside the country since taking office, is engaging in serious diplomacy.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has sought to distinguish himself not just from Democratic President Barack Obama but also from Bush, a Republican. Both failed to blunt North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, but where they have fallen short, Trump believes his more un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox approach can achieve success.\n\nSome Democrats have offered Trump modest praise for taking on more risk in his North Korea strategy. At an Arms Control Association conference this week, former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, a Democrat, said Trump was making \u201cthe correct gamble\u201d in agreeing to meet with Kim.\n\n\u201cAs I had looked at the Korean Peninsula the last few years, things couldn\u2019t be worse,\u201d said Richardson, who served as the U.N. ambassador under President Bill Clinton and traveled to Pyongyang several times. \u201cMissiles and nuclear weapons pointing at South Korea, artillery, conventional weapons. So I felt it was a risk worth taking.\u201d\n\nOther analysts, however, cautioned that Trump has offered no clear strategy, failing to articulate what the United States is willing to give up to the North and how the administration intends to ratify Pyongyang\u2019s compliance with any potential disarmament deal.\n\nAnother problem, some said, was that by ramping up expectations, Trump is setting himself up not just to fall short but also to give away too much to Kim in a frantic grasp for a deal that he can sell as a win to the American public.\n\nSeveral analysts suggested that Trump, in a bid to free three Americans who have been held in captivity by the North, might offer to meet Kim in Pyongyang \u2014 long considered a non-starter for a U.S. president because of security concerns and the domestic propaganda bonanza it would hand the regime.\n\nTrump has frequently invoked the case of college student Otto Warmbier, who died last summer a few days after being released from the North in a coma after 17 months in captivity. Analysts said the president could view a return on Air Force One with the other three Americans as a dramatic denouement that obscures any setbacks in nuclear talks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous that Trump is going to ignore advisers\u2019 counsel and go to Pyongyang to rescue the detainees,\u201d said Jung H. Pak, a former U.S. intelligence official who now serves as a Korea expert at Brookings Institution.\n\nAt his joint news conference with Abe, Trump was asked by a reporter to explain why CIA Director Mike Pompeo had returned without the three Americans from his secret meeting with Kim in Pyongyang over Easter weekend.\n\nThe president responded that his administration is \u201cfighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there\u2019s a good chance of doing it.\u201d But Trump did not call their release a precondition for the summit. One U.S. government official said privately that there has been no recent signals that the release of the hostages is imminent but added that it would be highly unlikely for Trump to meet with Kim and not secure the release of the prisoners in the same meeting.\n\nCha, the former Bush administration official, said if Trump speaks too openly about the hostages, that would give them too much tactical value to Pyongyang, allowing the North Koreans to \u201cfeel they can give you that and nothing else.\u201d Cha questioned whether Trump is \u201cwilling to sell the store, in the end, to say, \u2018I\u2019ve created peace; give me the Nobel Prize.\u2019 I feel we\u2019re headed down that path now.\u201d\n\nAmid criticism of his approach, Trump has sought to seize credit for what he has framed as significant progress already \u2014 forcing Beijing to clamp down on international trade embargoes against North Korea, convincing Kim to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea and luring the North Korean leader to the negotiating table.\n\nTrump asserted that Moon \u201chas been very generous that without us and without me in particular, I guess, you would have to say, that they wouldn\u2019t be discussing anything\u201d with the North.\n\n\u201cTypical Trump,\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, who led the U.S. delegation in the six-party talks with North Korea during the Bush administration. The president \u201ctries to say, \u2018Look at all this progress,\u2019 when frankly we could have had a meeting with the North Koreans anytime.\u201d\n\nMoon\u2019s administration had grown increasingly fearful that the escalating threats between Trump and Kim last year could lead to war. Pak, the former intelligence official, said the South Koreans, in a bid to tamp down Trump\u2019s bellicose rhetoric, have worked at \u201ccreating the success story for him.\u201d\n\nMoon told reporters in Seoul this week that the Kim regime signaled that it would no longer demand that U.S. troops leave the Korean Peninsula that had long been a requirement from Pyongyang as part of any nuclear disarmament deal \u2014 although analysts remain skeptical.\n\n\u201cThose are the scaffolding that they are building leading up to the North Korea-U.S. summit,\u201d Pak said. The South Koreans are \u201calready creating the agenda and the crescendo of victory. Kim has never said these things before, and it can be couched as a victory. My sense is that Trump is also embracing these as victories.\u201d\n\nJohn Hudson and Carol Morello contributed to this report."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/black-voters-warn-democrats-with-2020-ambitions-about-taking-them-for-granted/2018/04/20/16ba2a68-448c-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html", "published": null, "title": "Black voters warn Democrats with 2020 ambitions about taking them for granted", "text": "Gov.

But in 2016, with Hillary Clinton as the nominee, the black turnout rate fell to 60 percent, the first decline in 20 years.\n\n[4.4 million 2012 Obama voters stayed home in 2016 \u2014 more than a third of them black]\n\nDonald Trump, who had questioned whether Obama was born in the United States, did better with black voters than either of the Republican nominees who had challenged Obama.\n\nTo Sharpton, it seemed that Democrats, with plenty to offer black voters, had opted for a bland anti-Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cThey had not engaged in a lot of these issues,\u201d Sharpton said in an interview. \u201cFor a lot of them, 2016 was a wake-up call. If Hillary got more black votes in Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia, she\u2019d be president. They\u2019re finally getting that they were behind the learning curve.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have been working fast to change that. On Wednesday, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), another potential candidate for president, used the conference to announce that he would restore voting rights to felons on parole, potentially affecting 35,000 people. On Friday, in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nFor a while, the Republican Party was pretty confident that it had figured out its message for the 2018 midterms. It passed massive tax cuts in December, you see, and that would fill America\u2019s wallets to the point that voters could barely resist pulling the lever for the party come November.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out that way in the special election in Pennsylvania last month, where a Democrat won a district that President Trump had carried by 20 points \u2014 and where Republicans eventually gave up on trying to use the tax cuts to woo voters.\n\nBy the end of March, CNBC had conducted a poll to gauge the extent to which most Americans had noticed that they had more money in their paychecks thanks to scaled-back payroll taxes. Most Americans said they hadn\u2019t.\n\nOne group in which a majority claimed to have noticed more money: Republicans, half of whom said they\u2019d seen an increase.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious what role partisanship played here \u2014 Were Republicans trying to goose their party\u2019s success? Were Democrats trying to tamp down on the good news? \u2014 you can turn to independents. They were even less likely than Democrats to say they saw more take-home pay.\n\nSince then, the conversation about tax cuts has died down. Fox News continues to raise the subject more than its competitors, mentioning the cuts 381 times in the past month, compared with 119 times by CNN and 157 by MSNBC.\n\nBut public interest has waned. Even as Tax Day loomed, Americans weren\u2019t rushing to Google to learn how the tax cuts might affect them.\n\nOn Friday, though, some good news. One group of Americans most certainly had noticed the positive effects of the tax cuts, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s six big Wall Street banks posted record, or near record, profits in the first quarter,\u201d the AP\u2019s Ken Sweet reported. \u201cWhile higher interest rates allowed banks to earn more from lending in the first quarter, the main boost to banks came from the billions of dollars they saved in taxes under the tax law Trump signed in December. Combined, the six banks saved at least $3.59 billion last quarter, according to an Associated Press estimate, using the bank\u2019s tax rates going back to 2015.\u201d\n\n$3.6 billion. That\u2019s $11 for every American, if it were to be given to individual Americans, which it will not. Or, put another way, it\u2019s just shy of $40 million a day for those six banks. $27,700 a minute. About $462 a second.\n\nLet\u2019s make it tangible. Here\u2019s how much money those banks saved since you opened this article, assuming they\u2019re saving money in this quarter at the same rate that they did last quarter.\n\nTo be fair, the $28 each household would get if you divvied up the $3.6 billion among all American households pales next to the $1,600 each American household is expected to save on average this year. Of course those savings aren\u2019t evenly distributed; the Tax Policy Center notes that middle-income households are expected to save only $900.\n\nThose figures, though, are divvied up between 126 million households, not six banks. Those banks, it\u2019s very safe to assume, would gladly vote for the Republicans in the midterm elections.

Legal marijuana sales exceeded $9 billion in 2017, according to an industry estimate.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported that polls show that more than 60 percent of Americans favor legalizing marijuana completely and more than 90 percent are in favor of legal medical use.\n\nBut not all Americans have benefited from this shift in attitude. Some are still dealing with the consequences of strict drug laws.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillbrand (D-N.Y.) noted the disparity in how marijuana laws affect people of color, as well as low-income people.\n\n\u201cBlack and Latino people in NYC are arrested at TEN times the rate of white people for virtually the same rate of marijuana usage. Along with Cory Booker and Sen. Sanders, I\u2019m cosponsoring a bill to legalize and decriminalize marijuana. Raise your voices and join us in this fight,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nA Drug Policy Alliance report showed that arrests for offenses such as possession under the age of 21, public consumption and other still-illegal actions related to marijuana are higher for black people. Vox reported that several studies have found that even in places where pot is legal, black people are still more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses compared to white people.\n\nIn Colorado, according to a 2016 public safety report, the marijuana arrest rate for whites and Hispanics is comparable, but the marijuana arrest rate for African Americans is almost three times that of whites.\n\nThe relationship between the disproportionately high incarceration rate of black people and the role race plays in this country's history with drug decriminalization is likely to continue to be a conversation as Americans revisit U.S. drug laws. How the opioid epidemic has ravaged rural, mostly white areas has captured national attention. But how people of color in urban areas have been treated by this country's drug laws appears to be a lesser concern right now.\n\nVincent M. Southerland, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality and the Law at New York University, wrote in the New York Times:\n\n\u201cToo many people have been deported, made homeless, lost financial aid, levied fines and fees or had their children taken away from them because of marijuana arrests.\n\n\u201cWhite entrepreneurs in the marijuana industry, and the lawmakers who help it flourish, should highlight the racist history of marijuana prohibition and acknowledge its continuing impact.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/04/20/the-democrats-circumstantial-case-against-the-president-who-beat-them/", "published": null, "title": "The Democrats\u2019 circumstantial case against the president who beat them", "text": "\n\nHillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, speaks during the Democratic National Convention on July 28, 2016, in Philadelphia. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\nOne of the marvels of modern life is that our cultural behavior still hasn\u2019t caught up to the pace and volume that we\u2019re bombarded with. Human brains never had to consider the concept of \u201ctrillions\u201d until the past hundred years or so, and we\u2019re simply unprepared for it. One hundred? Sure. One million million? It\u2019s somewhere past 100 in the sense that Alpha Centauri is somewhere past Baltimore.\n\nThe same holds for information. Our ability to filter information is predicated on our adeptness at finding patterns. Given a few things, we can figure out what they have in common, a handy way for our abnormally robust brains to fill in the blanks. But there aren\u2019t any blanks anymore, not really; every nook and cranny of our lives is filled with information. It\u2019s easy, then, for us to apply our instinctive abilities to that volume of data and come to the wrong conclusions. You can\u2019t find a complete sentence in a bowl of alphabet soup, but in a volume of alphabet soup the size of the Atlantic Ocean, you can eventually cobble together the entire Harry Potter series.\n\nIn popular culture, we have two competing understandings of how conspiracies are uncovered. There\u2019s the \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d variety, in which journalists talk to people who individually have discrete pieces of information and figure out the newsworthy pattern. Then there\u2019s the \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d variety, in which a hyperactive ability to find patterns vacuums up everything nearby and figures out the thin tendrils by which they might be connected. You can find patterns wherever, given enough creativity and enough possible components. It\u2019s like building a house of Legos: You can connect any two things and can build whatever you want, given a big enough pile of blocks.\n\nThis has had an interesting effect on the economics of the current political moment. It\u2019s a moment in which there is a loosely articulated conspiracy involving Russian hackers and \u2014 potentially \u2014 agents of the president of the United States, a conspiracy of enormous stakes and enormous import. It\u2019s a moment in which that president is deeply unpopular, so there are plenty of people willing to do some digging to uncover links between the two. It\u2019s a moment in which uncovering those links leads to social-media fame for those more interested in applying brush-to-canvas in creative ways than painting a comprehensible, verifiable picture. And it\u2019s a moment in which there has never been a bigger ocean of soup from which to draw letters.\n\nOn Friday, the Democratic National Committee released a complaint against the 2016 campaign of President Trump \u2014 and against staffers for the campaign and against 10 unknown people and against WikiLeaks and \u2014 why not! \u2014 against Russia. The 66-page document attempts to establish authoritatively a connection between the Trump campaign (which certainly existed) and Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 election (which also certainly existed). But, as with so many other efforts, the lines drawn between the two are flimsy. Nonetheless, the DNC deliberately tries to draw them with a thicker weight than they deserve. The DNC\u2019s goal, after all, is not to present a fair case for Trump\u2019s having colluded with Russia. Its goal is to presenting a convincing case. And just as the protagonist of \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d created the conspiracy he wanted to see, so does this document create the conspiracy for which the party is looking.\n\nBut unlike \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d the DNC presumably knows that it\u2019s misleading itself.\n\nFor example, the complaint writes that Russia repeatedly communicated with agents of the campaign about its desire to hurt Clinton, which is true. It goes on to say that \u201cthe Trump Campaign and its agents\u201d welcomed that help. Agents did. Did \u201cthe campaign\u201d? There\u2019s a nebulous border to where \u201cthe campaign\u201d is drawn, which has certainly been to Trump\u2019s advantage over the past year. But is it fair to say that \u201cthe campaign\u201d welcomed help because adviser George Papadopoulos didn\u2019t tell federal authorities that he had been told about the Russians having dirt on Clinton?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, do those contacts between Russia and the campaign validate the DNC\u2019s claim that \u201cthe Trump Campaign, Trump\u2019s closest advisers, and Russian agents formed an agreement to promote Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy through illegal means\u201d? There\u2019s no new evidence in this document, mind you. The DNC simply claims that the uncertain or loose connections between the two are themselves the proof they\u2019re looking for.\n\nAt other times, the known evidence is misrepresented or ignored.\n\n\u201cTrump associates continued to secretly communicate with Russian agents and WikiLeaks as they strategically disseminated information stolen from targets,\u201d the DNC alleges. The evidence for this? Direct messages between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks and others between Roger Stone and the Russian intelligence officer calling himself \u201cGuccifer 2.0.\u201d\n\nBoth of those sets of messages have been made public; there\u2019s no credible evidence that any are still secret. And they\u2019re anodyne, at best; Guccifer trying to curry favor with an indifferent Stone or WikiLeaks and Trump Jr. dancing around each other with differing outcomes in mind. Small things are lifted from the alphabet soup and proclaimed to be important, like Stone predicting that leaks from Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta were imminent or WikiLeaks asking Trump Jr. to promote something shortly before Trump-the-candidate tweeted his support of WikiLeaks.\n\nStone\u2019s tweet about Podesta came well in advance of the leaks of Podesta\u2019s emails, and he\u2019s argued that the wording of his tweet \u2014 \u201csoon it will the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel\u201d \u2014 should be read as \u201cbe the Podestas\u201d not \u201c[be] Podesta\u2019s.\u201d Meaning that he predicted that John and his brother Tony Podesta would be targeted, and he didn\u2019t say anything about WikiLeaks. Over the summer, in fact, Stone kept predicting that an upcoming WikiLeaks release would target the Clinton Foundation, which it didn\u2019t.\n\nTrump Jr., meanwhile, was asked questions by WikiLeaks that he ignored and vice-versa. The tweet from Trump was a general promotion of WikiLeaks \u2014 but the request from WikiLeaks was to promote a specific link, which Trump Jr. tweeted a few days later.\n\nThe DNC complaint tries to have it both ways. In one section, they tout Trump\u2019s public praise of WikiLeaks as incriminating. In the next, they detail various times that the campaign tried to cover up its connections to the Russians. Look, either they didn\u2019t want attention drawn to their criminal conspiracy \u2014 which is what the DNC alleges existed \u2014 or they did.\n\nWe must now ensure that we keep cracked open the door through which all of this flows: It certainly could be the case that there was more direct, higher-level communication between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It could also be the case that what\u2019s known is already sufficient to result in significant political or further criminal repercussions. One way in which conspiracy theories work is that any small validation is seen as validation of the whole, deservedly or not. But in the interests of fairness, we have to grant that there still could be a there there, whether or not the DNC makes its case.\n\nI go back, over and over, to 2009 essay by Lawrence Lessig predicting that access to information on a massive scale could lead to conspiracy theories in which cherry-picked data was strung together in questionable ways. The skill we need to cultivate is the one in which we get better at filtering things out of our theories, recognizing that they\u2019re too neat or too tangential.\n\nOne of Lessig\u2019s point in his essay, though, was that there would be a political benefit to coming up with credible theories by using the DNC\u2019s process. Too much information, he wrote, \u201cis not going to inspire change. It will simply push any faith in our political system over the cliff.\u201d\n\nEspecially given an incentive for the push. By Friday afternoon, the DNC was fundraising on its complaint."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/20/whats-up-with-politicians-suddenly-embracing-pot/", "published": null, "title": "What\u2019s up with politicians suddenly embracing pot?", "text": "\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIt\u2019s not just because it\u2019s 4/20 \u2014 although that contributed to at least one important senator\u2019s announcement that he has come around to the idea of decriminalizing marijuana.\n\nMarijuana legalization advocates say they\u2019ve had the best week in Washington since \u2014 well, ever. And it\u2019s thanks to politicians on both sides, including the president, suddenly embracing efforts to help more states legalize marijuana.\n\n\u201cI think we reached critical mass among the population years ago,\u201d said Don Murphy, the director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, \u201cbut I think we are finally reaching critical mass on Capitol Hill now.\u201d\n\nConsider:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced Friday that he has decided to support decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level and will advocate bills to help marijuana businesses grow (no pun intended). Schumer cited an \u201cevolved thinking \u2014 both personally and by the nation\u201d for his switch. As The Washington Post\u2019s David Weigel writes, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that a leader of either party in Congress has endorsed a rollback of one of the country\u2019s oldest drug laws.\u201d\n\nThe Friday before, President Trump promised a Senate Republican from Colorado that he would protect states that have legalized marijuana. That\u2019s in stark contrast to what Trump\u2019s attorney general did earlier this year by rolling back Obama-era protections allowing states to create their own marijuana laws without fear of prosecution from the federal government. (The federal government says marijuana is illegal.) Trump\u2019s position on reconciling the different laws was vague before this.\n\nThis week, the House of Representatives held one of its first hearings ever on legislation to roll back medical marijuana regulations.\n\nAnd last week, former Republican House speaker John A. Boehner pulled a stunning 180 from his days in Congress and announced that he had joined the board of directors of a cannabis company. Boehner had once said he was \u201cunalterably opposed\u201d to decriminalizing marijuana because it would lead to more people abusing it, alcohol and other drugs.\n\nI\u2019m joining the board of #AcreageHoldings because my thinking on cannabis has evolved. I\u2019m convinced de-scheduling the drug is needed so we can do research, help our veterans, and reverse the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities. @AcreageCannabis https://t.co/f5i9KcQD0W \u2014 John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) April 11, 2018\n\nLegalization advocates say there is no one thing that has happened recently to spark these politicians to suddenly switch from their long-entrenched views. But there is plenty of evidence of states and public opinion moving, rather rapidly, in favor of marijuana legalization, and perhaps the politicians in Washington are taking notice.\n\nAll but two states have laws on the books at least recognizing the value of medical marijuana. Medical marijuana is legal in 29 states. Recreational marijuana is legal in nine states and the District, and advocates are optimistic that the number could double by the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAn October Gallup poll found record-high support for legalizing marijuana, including among Republicans:\n\n\u201cThe politics of it are making more sense every day,\u201d Murphy said, \u201ceven among Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, Republican lawmakers are considering legalizing recreational marijuana rather than letting an initiative that\u2019s gaining steam make the ballot this fall. GOP lawmakers fear that the ballot measure would boost Democratic turnout in November, reports the Detroit News. That would make Michigan only the second state where marijuana has been legalized by the legislature, after Vermont did so earlier this year. That bill was signed by a Republican governor, Phil Scott.\n\nIn the fall, voters in Oklahoma and Utah will consider marijuana measures. In 2016, voters in Arkansas, North Dakota and Florida overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana legalization. Those are all states Trump won.\n\nIt\u2019s probably less of a surprise that Democratic gubernatorial and attorney general candidates are practically tripping over themselves to support marijuana legalization, said Karen O\u2019Keefe of the Marijuana Policy Project.\n\nIn Schumer\u2019s home state of New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) is facing a primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, who has made marijuana legalization a central feature of her campaign. Cuomo initiated a statewide study this year on what legalizing marijuana would mean for New York.\n\nOf course, not everyone in Washington suddenly wants to see pot legalized everywhere. On Friday, to counter the 4/20 programming, Smart Approaches to Marijuana held a news conference in downtown D.C. to reiterate its opposition to marijuana legalization. The group\u2019s director, Kevin Sabet, said SAM would be ramping up its federal lobbying efforts and will soon call on support from families suffering from the national opioid crisis, \u201c80 percent of whom will tell you marijuana had a role to play.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, said Sabet and Rafael Lemaitre, a former spokesman for the Obama White House drug office, is that a nascent marijuana industry has poured millions of dollars into lobbying.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take it for granted anymore\u201d that politicians will reject marijuana legalization, Sabet said in an interview with The Fix, \u201cbut we also don\u2019t think it's inevitable.\u201d\n\nBut opponents appear to be fighting a losing battle at the moment. Election-year politics can never be entirely separated from politicians\u2019 decisions. It\u2019s possible Schumer is watching what\u2019s happening in his home state and the overwhelming support for legalization within his own party, and decided that backing marijuana could boost the chances of Democrats taking back control of the Senate in November.\n\nWhatever the reason, O\u2019Keefe said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing politicians\u2019 evolution on this issue quickly.\u201d\n\nSo quickly, apparently, that even glacial-paced Washington is starting to take notice."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/20/is-marijuana-decriminalization-possible-in-the-middle-east/", "published": null, "title": "Is marijuana decriminalization possible in the Middle East?", "text": "\n\nA Tunisian boy cycles past street art in Erriadh, a village on the resort island of Djerba, south of Tunis in 2015. (Mosa\u2019ab Elshamy/AP)\n\nOn Jan. 1, Tunisian police reportedly arrested four people in Tunis with marijuana in their car. Their arrests came almost exactly one year after Tunisia\u2019s justice minister said the country was facing a crisis in its prison system, exacerbated in large part by the country\u2019s harsh drug laws. These two events \u2014 and efforts to remove penalties for marijuana use \u2014 illustrate both the achievements of and obstacles to drug-sentencing reform amid broader efforts toward judicial and security-sector reform in post-revolutionary Tunisia.\n\nLink between drug sentencing and prison overcrowding\n\nIn 1992, the Tunisian government enacted Law 52, which strengthened drug criminalization and imposed harsh mandatory prison sentences. For simple possession of small amounts of marijuana, a first-time offender was to receive one to five years and a fine between $400 and $1,200. Those charged with growing or distributing narcotics faced six to 10 years with a fine of $2,000 to $4,000. Those linked to smuggling groups faced mandatory sentences of 20 years to life, in addition to fines ranging from $40,000 to $400,000.\n\nJudges were given no discretion to reduce any of these minimum sentences in light of mitigating circumstances or the availability of alternative disciplinary measures.\n\nBy the end of 2016, Tunisia housed over 23,000 prisoners \u2014 while the official capacity of the Tunisian prison system is an estimated 18,000. One-third of these prisoners are there for drug offenses \u2014 and the majority of drug cases involve young men caught with small amounts of marijuana. In 2016 alone, over 56 percent of those arrested were detained for drug use, primarily cannabis.\n\nEfforts at reform in the region\n\nIn the Middle East and North Africa, penalties associated with the possession and use of cannabis remain harsh given global movement toward depenalization. The death penalty is allowed for drug offenses in 14 of the 19 countries in the region (though only a handful of those countries regularly carry out such executions). Like Tunisia, many countries also experience prison overcrowding.\n\nBut there are growing reform efforts in several Middle Eastern and North Arfican countries. In Lebanon, Skoun, a Beirut-based civil society organization, has been working since 2011 to reduce criminal sentences associated with drug use and improve addiction services in the country.\n\nIn Morocco, one of the world\u2019s largest marijuana producers, the government oscillates between cracking down and offering tacit acceptance of cannabis farming, particularly in the impoverished Rif region \u2014 where marijuana cultivation represents a pillar of peasant farmers\u2019 livelihoods. In 2014, Morocco\u2019s Party of Authenticity and Modernity, whose founder Fouad Ali El Himma is a close adviser to King Mohammed VI, released a draft law to legalize marijuana cultivation for medicinal purposes but maintain a ban on recreational use.\n\nIn Tunisia, the government doubled down, passing a law in 2015 reaffirming Law 52. At the same time, human rights groups and civil society activists, escalated calls for reform. These civil society organizations highlighted how Law 52 targets young men from marginalized communities \u2014 and called attention to the economic and social costs. Often, those with past drug convictions \u2014 however minor \u2014 have no path toward reintegration into the Tunisian workforce.\n\nWhile the members of Tunisia\u2019s different political parties did not agree about whether to fully repeal Law 52, a consensus formed around reducing prison sentences for first- and second-time offenders accused of marijuana consumption.\n\nOn March 15, 2017, Tunisia\u2019s government issued regulations allowing judges to pardon defendants as soon as their judgment is announced so that prison time is avoided. Law 52 was modified \u2014 and judges now have discretion in sentencing for the first two drug offenses. They can consider mitigating circumstances and recommend alternatives to prison, such as medical evaluation and treatment. On May 15, 2017, a criminal court in Tunisia handed down the first modified sentence: a suspended prison sentence of one year and a 1,000 TND fine. Human rights groups and civil society activists commended the change but also endorsed further changes, arguing that judicial discretion has its own limitations and risks.\n\nSince then, several of the government ministers expressed a need for further reform. Leading members of Ennahda, the main Islamist political party, also expressed support for reform. While many say they want to reduce harsh sentences, full decriminalization of marijuana-related offenses appears a very distant prospect.\n\nPathways to building greater public support\n\nIn ongoing public opinion research in Tunisia, we examine the public\u2019s support for or opposition to criminal justice reform policies. In July 2017, we fielded a public opinion survey asking respondents to report the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with a variety of policies proposed to address violent extremism in Tunisia.\n\nAlthough our question framed decriminalization in the specific context of extremism and prison overcrowding, the results indicate that, given that framing, approximately 60 percent of respondents oppose decriminalization of low-level drug offenses, with nearly 45 percent of respondents saying that they strongly oppose such measures.\n\nChanges to the way that the government conducts and reports drug-related arrests would represent an important step in building more public support for the depenalization of drug use.\n\nAs Tunisia moves toward reducing the criminal penalties associated with marijuana, our survey responses also suggest that work by civil society activists should focus on making the case for depenalization or decriminalization to the public directly, in addition to advocating for change among the political elites.\n\nAlexandra Blackman is a PhD candidate in political science at Stanford University.\n\nFarah Samti is a Fulbright fellow and MA candidate in International Studies at the University of Oregon."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/20/the-forbes-400-and-how-trumps-shameless-self-promotion-helped-make-him-president/", "published": null, "title": "The Forbes 400 and how Trump\u2019s shameless self-promotion helped make him president", "text": "Journalist Jonathan Greenberg writes for The Washington Post on Friday about how President Trump conned his way onto the Forbes 400 list in the 1980s by inflating his wealth and using a fake name to pose as his own spokesman.\n\nTrump's fraud might have been nothing more than an amusing caper in which the only victim was another rich person deprived of his or her rightful place on the list, but Greenberg captures the significance in this key passage:\n\nHis confident deceptions were so big that they had an unexpected effect: Instead of believing that they were outright fabrications, my Forbes colleagues and I saw them simply as vain embellishments on the truth. We were so wrong. This was a model Trump would use for the rest of his career, telling a lie so cosmic that people believed that some kernel of it had to be real. The tactic landed him a place he hadn\u2019t earned on the Forbes list \u2014 and led to future accolades, press coverage and deals. It eventually paved a path toward the presidency.\n\n[Trump lied to me about his wealth to get onto the Forbes 400. Here are the tapes.]\n\nTrump is not in the White House merely because he was on the Forbes 400 list. But Greenberg's valid point is that Trump's shameless \u2014 and sometimes dishonest \u2014 style of self-promotion helped him build the image of success personified, which he later parlayed into a winning campaign to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nThe pseudonym Trump employed when talking to Greenberg, John Barron, is one he used on multiple occasions. He sometimes spelled the name \u201cBaron\u201d or went by John Miller but, whatever the spelling or the surname, Trump's aim was to boast about himself, without appearing to boast about himself.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, The Post published a recording of a 1991 interview that \u201cMiller,\u201d who was actually Trump, gave to People magazine. On the tape, \u201cMiller\u201d asserted that Trump is \u201cstarting to do tremendously well financially,\u201d and that \u201cactresses just call to see if they can go out with him and things.\u201d\n\nAlso during the campaign, a former editor of the New York Post's Page Six gossip section penned a confession in Politico Magazine: \u201cI helped make the myth of Donald Trump,\u201d Susan Mulcahy wrote. \u201cAnd for that, I am very, very sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you worked for a newspaper in New York in the 1980s, you had to write about Trump,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs editor of the New York Post\u2019s Page Six, and later as a columnist for New York Newsday, I needed to fill a lot of space, ideally with juicy stories of the rich and powerful, and Trump more than obliged.\u201d\n\nA May 1984 New York Daily News column by Mike Lupica illustrates the extent to which Trump \u201cmore than obliged.\u201d Referring to Trump, then 37, as the \u201cBoy Builder,\u201d Lupica describes Trump's dogged pursuit of media coverage:\n\nI was buying the papers at my quaint little newsstand when all of a sudden the Boy Builder jumped off the rack from the cover of Gentlemen's Quarterly, tapped me on the shoulder, grinned his sappy grin and said, \u201cGotcha.\u201d The headline in GQ read: \u201cDonald Trump Gets What He Wants.\u201d I thought about running. I gave up. I bought the magazine. The Boy Builder and I went back to my apartment for coffee. He gets what he wants. If it isn't GQ, then it's Sports Illustrated, which a couple of months ago did a major fawn over Trump that included everything except baby pictures. If it isn't SI, it's the New York Times Magazine (I like to look at the pictures). Trump was waiting for me there not long ago; I reached down for the Sunday papers on my doorstep and before I knew it, Trump was scrambling eggs for us. I read an NFL draft story in the New York News. The first quote was from Trump. He was in Monday's paper, too.\n\nLupica's column ran in the same month that Trump had one of his phone conversations with Greenberg, as \u201cJohn Barron.\u201d Acting in person or under an assumed name, Trump relentlessly thrust himself into the press, then reaped the benefits three decades later."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/04/20/the-comey-memos-bolster-his-claim-that-he-didnt-leak-classified-information/", "published": null, "title": "The Comey memos bolster his claim that he didn\u2019t leak classified information", "text": "\n\nPresident Trump speaking on April 5, left, and former FBI director James B.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018\n\nThe memos do not show that \u201cthere was NO COLLUSION.\u201d In fact, in the memo dated March 30, Trump suggests that it would be good to determine whether there was some \u201csatellite\u201d to his campaign \u2014 some adviser or tangential figure \u2014 who might have had improper contacts with the Russians. He says this in the context of a Washington Post article about a man who had had contact with just such a person: George Papadopoulos. He was the \u201csatellite\u201d adviser who learned from a London-based professor that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and who triggered the entire counterintelligence investigation after he told that to an Australian diplomat, who then told the FBI.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s no way for any memo to show there was no collusion. No matter what a memo says, there could still be evidence of collusion elsewhere. And that argument, of course, also holds for Trump\u2019s claim of NO OBSTRUCTION: If the memos showed no obstruction, that wouldn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t any somewhere else.\n\nBut the memos do hint at obstruction, the same obstruction that has been known about for months. One memo details the conversation between Trump and Comey in which Trump tells his FBI director that he hopes Comey can let the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn go. This is a central piece of the obstruction puzzle, an apparent effort by the president to cut short a criminal investigation. Comey himself told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that this particular incident constituted evidence of obstruction.\n\nThat memo, too, is the one that Comey asked a friend to share with the New York Times last May. And it\u2019s that memo that\u2019s at the center of the third claim in Trump\u2019s tweet, that the memos show that Comey \u201cleaked classified information.\u201d\n\nIn fact, they show the opposite.\n\nA timeline is important here. Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017. On May 11, the New York Times reported on details from Comey\u2019s meeting with Trump at the end of January, during which Trump asked Comey for loyalty.\n\n\u201cThe conversation that night in January, Mr. Comey now believes, was a harbinger of his downfall this week as head of the F.B.I.,\u201d the Times\u2019s Michael Schmidt wrote, \u201caccording to two people who have heard his account of the dinner.\u201d There is no mention in this article of any memo, which is important.\n\nThat May 11 article prompted a response from the president on Twitter the next day, a Friday.\n\nJames Comey better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017\n\nComey told the Senate Intelligence Committee last June how he reacted when he saw that tweet.\n\n\u201cThe president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there\u2019s not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn\u2019t dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation. There might a tape. My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. Didn\u2019t do it myself for a variety of reasons. I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. I asked a close friend to do it.\n\nThat friend was Columbia University professor Daniel Richman. He spoke with Schmidt, who then reported on Trump\u2019s comments about letting the Flynn investigation go as memorialized in the memo dated Feb. 14, 2017.\n\nAfter Comey revealed that he had given the memo to a friend, Trump seized upon the idea that some of the memos Comey wrote contained classified information.\n\n\u201cJames Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media,\u201d he wrote in a July 10 tweet. \u201cThat is so illegal!\u201d But as we noted at the time there was no evidence that the memo Comey shared was one of those that was classified. (Trump\u2019s tweet was based on a Fox News report that was later corrected.)\n\nWe now know with certainty that Trump was wrong.\n\nThere are two Times stories at issue here, using information from two different memos. The first Times story centers on the conversation in that Jan. 28 dinner between Trump and Comey. The classification originally applied to the document was \u201cconfidential.\u201d\n\n(But for the Department of Justice releasing it on Thursday, we would have had to wait until Dec. 31, 2042, for it to be declassified.)\n\nThen there was the memo for the Feb. 14 conversation. It was unclassified.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that we only know Comey gave the latter memo to Richman. Richman later told CNN that he had never been given any memo marked \u201cclassified,\u201d but it\u2019s not clear whether the versions from Comey would have been marked. Clearly someone leaked details that were contained in the former memo to the Times for its report about Trump\u2019s loyalty request \u2014 but not the memo itself. If the existing redactions in that document are any guide, it was classified as \u201cconfidential\u201d mostly for its discussion of Flynn, not the details about the dinner with Trump.\n\nIn July of last year, Fox News reported that Richman had told them that he had received four memos from Comey. (It appears to be the only outlet to have reported this.) Slate theorizes that this is why Republicans wanted the memos to be released: After all, if four of the seven memos included classified information (as was known before Thursday\u2019s release), then, if he received four documents, Richman must have received at least one document that was classified. The release of the memos, though, make clear that the memo which we know Comey gave to Richman wasn\u2019t classified. Slate asked Richman to clarified what he had received, without response; they speculate that perhaps Richman received four pages of documents. Regardless, the conflict between the Fox News report and the number of classified documents wasn\u2019t newly revealed on Thursday.\n\nUpdate: Comey\u2019s book addresses what he gave Richman.\n\nComey writes, \u201cI told him I was going to send him one unclassified memo and I wanted him to share the substance of the memo \u2013but not the memo itself \u2013 with a reporter.\u201d That memo, he says, was the one from Feb. 14.\n\nIt\u2019s worth walking through this again, for clarity. On May 11, the Times reported on a dinner that Comey wrote about in a memo that was classified as \u201cconfidential,\u201d though the loyalty request part of that document doesn\u2019t seem to have been the trigger for the classification. Trump tweeted about that report, prompting Comey the next Monday to give at least one unclassified memo to a friend to leak to the Times. He did so.\n\nPut more simply, there\u2019s no indication from the release on Thursday that Comey gave Richman classified information. There\u2019s no indication in the memos themselves that Comey leaked anything at all, of course, which also runs contrary to Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet wasn\u2019t entirely wrong, mind you. Comey\u2019s memos did indeed prompt a response of \u201cWow!\u201d\n\nUpdate: The Wall Street Journal reports that Comey did share four memos with Richman, two of which contained classified information as written. The paper\u2019s Byron Tau and Aruna Viswanatha write:\n\n\u201cOf those two memos, Mr. Comey himself redacted elements of one that he knew to be classified to protect secrets before he handed the documents over to his friend. He determined at the time that another memo contained no classified information, but after he left the Federal Bureau of Investigation, bureau officials upgraded it to \u2018confidential,\u2019 the lowest level of classification.\u201d\n\nOnly two of the memos were classified as confidential: The one detailing the Jan. 28 dinner and the last one, written in April. It\u2019s not clear when Comey gave the memos to Richman.\n\n\n\nGlenn Kessler contributed to this report.\n\n"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/20/nirvana-stain-the-week-in-one-song/", "published": null, "title": "Nirvana, \u2018Stain\u2019: The Week In One Song", "text": "Former FBI director James B.

But the meeting had barely gotten underway when President Trump turned his attention to Scott Pruitt\u2019s \u201crough week.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency administrator had suffered a barrage of negative headlines about spending on first-class travel, his large security detail and steep raises for two favored aides, as well as a Capitol Hill condo Pruitt had leased from a Washington lobbyist for $50 a night.\n\nAs Pruitt, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and White House counsel Donald McGahn listened, Trump mused about the size of the raises and whether the lease was indeed market rate, according to two senior administration officials familiar with the discussion. Then he switched to a happier subject, noting that Pruitt had shed \u201ca lot of bureaucrats\u201d from the agency.\n\nYes, Pruitt assured him. EPA staffing was \u201cdown to Reagan-era levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Scott,\u201d the president said, approvingly. But of the bad publicity, he added: \u201cCool it.\u201d\n\nSince then, Pruitt has adopted a determined strategy to placate the president and lie low. On his frequent travels, including a Midwest trip Thursday, he has given up first class for coach when possible, according to aides. And he made a point of honoring a White House request for Cabinet officials to stop by a memorial to opioid victims installed on the Ellipse.\n\n\n\nScott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House in early April amid scrutiny of his ethics and management decisions. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nBut while Trump has tweeted that Pruitt is \u201cdoing a great job,\u201d the EPA chief is hardly out of the woods, yet.\n\nThis week, the Government Accountability Office found that his installation of a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in EPA headquarters had violated federal spending laws. The EPA\u2019s inspector general announced that it will probe his decision to have his security detail accompany him on personal trips. And more than half a dozen other inquiries are underway within the EPA, at the White House and on Capitol Hill, where Pruitt is slated to testify twice next week about his spending and management practices.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has finally approved former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to be Pruitt\u2019s deputy, a development that has been closely monitored inside the West Wing. The day Trump signed Wheeler\u2019s paperwork, a White House official said, aides in the West Wing called the agency to ask how soon the new deputy administrator would start.\n\nThe low-key Wheeler \u2014 a former staffer in EPA and the Senate \u2014 was sworn in Friday, and his arrival could make Pruitt expendable should more embarrassing revelations surface, according to people inside and outside the administration. While Pruitt has long been a Trump favorite, he also has acquired a reputation as unresponsive and unwilling to take advice or instruction, according to three current and former White House aides, defiantly insisting that he has done nothing wrong and that Trump supports him.\n\n\u201cHe believes in the audience of one,\u201d said a senior White House official.\n\nEPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox declined to discuss Pruitt\u2019s management practices, saying in a statement that the EPA chief remains focused on policy results.\n\n\u201cAdministrator Pruitt has visited over 30 states. We will continue to visit those ignored by the Obama administration and implement President Trump\u2019s agenda of regulatory certainty and environmental stewardship,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nThis story is based on interviews with 17 current and former officials in Washington and Oklahoma, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. They described Pruitt\u2019s predicament as largely self-inflicted, the result of poor decisions by the EPA chief and a small cadre of trusted aides.\n\nThough Pruitt continues to win high marks within the administration on policy, one EPA staffer said his management of the agency has become \u201ca factory of bad ideas.\u201d\n\nBefore coming to Washington last year, Pruitt was a rising star in Republican circles. Twice elected Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Pruitt had gained national prominence by challenging Obama environmental policies. He once described himself as \u201ca leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda.\u201d\n\nAs attorney general, Pruitt displayed hints of his taste for VIP treatment and high-end travel. He ditched his predecessor\u2019s aging 2006 Lincoln sedan and spent $88,500 to buy two Chevy SUVs \u2014 a 2014 Tahoe and a 2015 Suburban \u2014 according to the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. Pruitt also had an armed agent serve as his driver, shuttling him the 100 miles from his home in Tulsa to his headquarters in Oklahoma City, according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nPruitt\u2019s two political action committees also raised and spent nearly $1 million over a two-year period starting in 2015, much of it on organizational expenses such as consultant fees and rooms at high-end hotels in Dallas, New York, New Orleans and Washington.\n\nPruitt, known as hard working and aggressive, largely avoided the sort of controversy that has defined his time at EPA, an $8-billion-a-year operation that dwarfs the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s roughly $13 million annual appropriation.\n\nIn Oklahoma, \u201cthere were very few opportunities for an executive officer to engage in profligate or excessive spending,\u201d said University of Oklahoma political science professor Keith Gaddie.\n\nPruitt\u2019s arrival in Washington, however, seemed to bring a fixation on symbols of status, according to current and former administration officials. He demanded to travel on private or military jets, like the president and higher-ranking Cabinet secretaries. Aides even investigated a charter plane contract, but rejected the $100,000 monthly cost as too expensive.\n\nMore high-profile and polarizing than many of his predecessors, Pruitt immediately became the subject of threats on social media and elsewhere, EPA officials said, causing him to embrace a broad range of security recommendations. Agency officials installed the private phone booth and biometric locks in his new office and, on the advice of his security chief, Pasquale \u201cNino\u201d Perrotta, spent $3,000 to have the place swept for listening devices. (The agency hired one of Perrotta\u2019s outside business partners to perform the task.)\n\n\u201cSimilar security sweeps were done for EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy,\u201d Wilcox said Friday.\n\nPruitt also accepted a round-the-clock protective detail, an unusual move for an EPA secretary, which so far has cost taxpayers at least $3 million in salaries and travel costs.\n\nOther ideas were rejected: A plan to install a key card swipe system on the double doors leading to the waiting area outside Pruitt\u2019s office. A request for a staffer to hand-deliver news clips about Pruitt to his home before he left for the office each day. A proposal to rent a second unit for Pruitt\u2019s security detail in the luxury U Street apartment building where Pruitt was living last fall.\n\nIn \u201cthe current location security/special agents are not the norm, and as a result, we are now rather conspicuous\u201d parked on the street overnight, Henry Barnet, the head of EPA\u2019s Office of Criminal Enforcement, Forensics and Training, wrote in a Sept. 22 email to senior EPA officials.\n\nThe questionable spending quickly alienated many staffers at EPA, including some Trump administration loyalists hired by Pruitt. At least half a dozen political appointees have left the agency, including Pruitt\u2019s longtime associate and head of the Office of Policy, Samantha Dravis.\n\nAnother departed Trump appointee, Kevin Chmielewski, accused Pruitt of excessive spending and ethical missteps in conversations with congressional investigators.\n\n\u201cWhen [Chmielewski] refused to support your unethical and inappropriate spending, he was marginalized, removed from his senior position and placed on administrative leave,\u201d several Democratic lawmakers wrote to Pruitt in an April 12 letter. Others were \u201cpunished, demoted, and retaliated against when they tried to resist inappropriate directions that came from you or through your favored staff,\u201d the letter said.\n\nFor example, after Pruitt\u2019s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, raised questions about a plan for Pruitt to travel to Morocco in December, Pruitt texted Jackson and disinvited him from future scheduling meetings, according to Chmielewski.\n\nMeanwhile, Pruitt\u2019s favorite aides were rewarded. This spring, EPA senior counsel Sarah Greenwalt was approved for a 52 percent raise, from $107,435 to $164,200, while scheduling and advance director Millan Hupp had her salary boosted by 33 percent to $114,590. Both women had worked for Pruitt in Oklahoma.\n\nThe agency later reversed the raises after a public outcry, and Pruitt told Trump and disapproving White House aides that he had not known about them in advance.\n\nBut a Feb. 27 email obtained by The Washington Post suggests Pruitt was aware they were in the works. In it, Greenwalt asks an EPA human resources official whether she will receive \u201can increase in salary as previously discussed with the Administrator.\u201d\n\nAsked about the emails, Wilcox said, \u201cSalary determinations for appointees are made by EPA\u2019s chief of staff, White House liaison, and career human resources officials. Salaries are based on work history; and, any increases are due to either new and additional responsibilities or promotions.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Pruitt has soldiered on in his campaign to roll back environmental regulations and prioritize traditional EPA roles such as cleaning up toxic waste sites and upgrading aging water infrastructure around the country.\n\nBut Pruitt\u2019s personal controversies threaten to overshadow his professional pursuits. Earlier this month, the White House canceled a joint appearance with Trump where Pruitt planned to announce changes to how states must comply with federal air-quality standards. Trump later signed the order without fanfare.\n\nPruitt has tried to tamp down the bad publicity. Since The Post first reported on his routine purchase of first-class airline tickets in February, he has continued domestic trips but also has postponed trips to Israel, Mexico and China.\n\nBut Pruitt has fumed privately about the constraints on his travels and his ambitions. Two agency employees said they recently heard him liken his cloistered, wood-paneled office at EPA headquarters to \u201ca prison.\u201d\n\nAaron C.

Comey\u2019s memos about his conversations with President Trump leaked Thursday night \u2014 shortly after they were sent to Congress by the Justice Department. And the prevailing wisdom is that House Republicans were behind the leak.\n\nBut did the leak actually do them and Trump any favors?\n\nIt\u2019s tough to see what in the memos was great for Trump, even as he claimed Friday morning that they show there was \u201cno collusion\u201d and \u201cno obstruction.\u201d\n\nJames Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018\n\nIn contrast, some read the memos as actually potentially validating the claims in the Steele dossier. In one memo, Comey notes Trump mentioned how Russian President Vladimir Putin had boasted to him about how Russia had, in Comey\u2019s words, \u201csome of the most beautiful hookers in the world.\u201d In another, Comey says certain claims in the dossier had been corroborated, even at that early date.\n\nLet\u2019s parse all that.\n\nThe \u201chookers\u201d comment\n\nHere\u2019s what Comey's memo says about this alleged Putin comment to Trump:\n\nThe President said \u2018the hookers thing\u2019 is nonsense but that Putin had told him \u201cwe have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.\u201d He did not say when Putin had told him this and I don\u2019t recall [REDACTED].\n\nThe idea that Putin actually said this is easy to believe, because he has even said it publicly. In a January 2017 interview with Bloomberg News, Putin said he doubted Trump met prostitutes in Russia in 2013, as the Steele dossier claims. (A refresher: The dossier\u2019s most salacious claim is that Russia had a tape of Trump watching prostitutes urinate on themselves on a bed and that it could be used as kompromat, or compromising information, against him.) But then Putin also slipped in an aside to Bloomberg that Russian prostitutes \u201care undoubtedly the best in the world.\u201d\n\nAs The Post's Philip Bump notes, it seems at least possible Trump was relaying something he had read and that Comey misunderstood him. But if Trump wasn\u2019t, that means Putin perhaps conspicuously brought up the quality of Russian prostitutes twice \u2014 while talking to and about Trump.\n\nThe most conspiratorial read on that would be that it was a not-so-subtle suggestion that Putin actually had the tape that the Steele dossier alleges and wanted Trump to know about it. The fact that Putin is a former KGB agent lends credence to the idea that he\u2019d want Trump to think he had something on him \u2014 if the tape even exists, which we have no solid evidence of.\n\nPutin bringing this up in the Bloomberg interview could be read as him trying to plant a seed publicly about the possibility of the tape\u2019s existence \u2014 a gambit that would certainly fit with Russia\u2019s campaign to stir unrest in the United States. But bringing it up privately with Trump would carry little guarantee that it would even come out publicly. If Putin was indeed trying to be suggestive, doing it one-on-one with Trump would seem more nefarious.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the full context of the Trump-Putin conversation. Did Trump raise the Steele dossier with Putin in that conversation, just as Putin in the Bloomberg interview was responding specifically to a question about the allegation that he has the tape? That might explain why Putin would bring it up, weird as the comment is. Maybe he\u2019s just truly proud of his country\u2019s sex workers.\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing that, while Comey has suggested in recent days that it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d the tape exists, he has also said it\u2019s \u201cunlikely.\u201d And when CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper pressed him on this point Thursday, Comey offered two reasons it\u2019s possible: first, that Trump keeps denying it, and second, that Trump wouldn\u2019t criticize Putin, even privately. Comey didn\u2019t specifically mention Putin\u2019s comments about Russia having the best prostitutes as part of his reasoning.\n\nThat portions of the dossier had been corroborated\n\nThe second excerpt of the memos some have seized upon is this one, in which Comey in February 2017 recounts talking to Reince Priebus, who was then White House chief of staff. When Priebus inquired, Comey said he told Trump about the dossier because portions of it had already been \u201ccorroborated\u201d:\n\nI explained that the analysts from all three agencies agreed it was relevant and that portions of the material were corroborated by other intelligence. ... I explained that the primary source [REDACTED] much of it was consistent with and corroborative of other intelligence, and that the incoming president needed to know the rest of it was out there.\n\nThis rebuts Republican allegations that the dossier is a series of baseless claims used as a pretext for spying on Trump campaign aide Carter Page and launching the Russia investigation: \u201cCorroborated,\u201d \u201ccorroborative.\u201d The dossier, according to Comey, had been corroborated in part as of early 2017, right around the time it went public.\n\nThat isn\u2019t hugely surprising. Other officials have said, anonymously, that portions have been corroborated. And the opposition research firm that commissioned Steele, Fusion GPS, has also said it believed portions of the dossier were corroborated.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know what has been corroborated. And just because some parts have been corroborated doesn\u2019t mean the entire document is gospel. The dossier, after all, contains a series of disparate claims based upon disparate sources who may be of varying degrees of reliability. There are also claims in the dossier that aren\u2019t nearly as outlandish as the Russian prostitute claim. Those may be confirmed without the most salacious and damning allegations being true. While Steele was well regarded as an intelligence agent, the dossier did not contain thoroughly vetted and proven claims.\n\nThat said, Comey at this early juncture was led to believe the dossier was at least partially legit. And now we have a contemporaneous and public record of that."}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-complains-that-comey-is-making-money-off-his-book-while-flynns-life-is-totally-destroyed/2018/04/20/6d5d0110-415d-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html", "published": null, "title": "Trump complains that Comey is making money off his book while Flynn\u2019s life is \u2018totally destroyed\u2019", "text": "President Trump took to Twitter on Friday to complain that the life of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has been \u201ctotally destroyed,\u201d and bemoan that fired FBI director James B.

He's not five minutes loyal.\u201d\n\nJay Goldberg, a lawyer who represented Trump in the 1990s and 2000s, told the Wall Street Journal this week that he warned the president about Cohen:\n\nMr. Goldberg said he cautioned the president not to trust Mr. Cohen. On a scale of 100 to 1, where 100 is fully protecting the president, Mr. Cohen \u201cisn't even a 1,\u201d he said he told Mr. Trump.\n\nGoldberg's warning received extensive coverage on cable news.\n\nTuesday on ABC's \u201cThe View,\u201d a lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti, said there is \u201cno question\u201d in his mind that Cohen will betray Trump.\n\n\u201cMichael Cohen has a family,\u201d Avenatti said. \u201cHe has kids. I understand that he's a fairly devoted father, and he's not going to look at his wife and say, 'No, I'm going to go take a bullet for this president' and go serve decades or 10 years or five years \u2014 I think it's at least 10 \u2014 in a federal penitentiary. Why would he do that? I mean this is a man that \u2014 listen, Mr. Trump left him behind when he went to Washington. He hasn't done him any favors.\u201d\n\nTo Avenatti's point about Cohen being left behind, The Washington Post's Philip Rucker, Josh Dawsey and Robert Costa reported last week that \u201cCohen has long been a fixer for Trump, as well as his family and business, and associates said he was disappointed when he was not brought officially on board the campaign, and again when he was passed over for a coveted White House job.\u201d\n\nIf Cohen is watching TV or reading newspapers or online articles, then he cannot escape reminders that Trump's loyalty often goes only one way. And if he was not already contemplating a flip, then all the coverage might make him think."}]}, "cbsnews": {"rss": "https://www.cbsnews.com/latest/rss/main", "link": "", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southwest-airlines-deadly-accident-faa-orders-more-inspections-jet-engine-2018-04-20/", "published": "2018-04-20T22:46:00", "title": "FAA orders inspections of more engines like one in deadly Southwest incident", "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered emergency inspections of jet engines like the one in this week's fatal Southwest Airlines accident.

It eventually cost $43,000, which included painting, floor and ceiling work and prepping the room. Presented with four pricing options ranging between $20,560 and $24,570, career officials chose the most expensively priced because it included \"expedited materials and working outside regular business hours.\"\n\nYet the emails also indicate that flags may have been raised.\n\nIn one email, dated June 28, 2017, Gayle Jefferson, Director of Facilities Management and Services Division, says \"The secure room for the Administrator appears to be taking on a life of its own.\"\n\nOn that same e-mail chain, on June 27, staffers were trying to determine whether the floor would be able \"to handle the weight of the booth\", later described as a \"600-800 LB box.\" Sebastien Guilmard, whose LinkedIn page describes him as a Senior Project Architect for the EPA, says that another staffer \"brings up a good point about the weight. But we may also be able to use white noise to achieve same goal.\"\n\nOn September 27, deputy chief of staff Reginald Allen was told in an e-mail that \"the booth made it to the news\u2026It is a legal purchase but will be scrutinized.\" Allen replied: \"Understand this was a requirement directed by the Administrator[']s political and Security team that they demanded, they (Kevin C and Nino P) spoke with several times about this asking to speed delivery.

Chmielewski has told Democratic lawmakers that he was put on administrative leave agency after questioning Pruitt's spending.\n\nEPA officials point out that the documents show Allen and Chmielewski were on the string of emails. Yet, dozens of other career officials were also part of the decision making process, the emails show.\n\n\"Administrator Pruitt simply requested a secure phone line, but never asked for a soundproof booth, nor did he have knowledge of its purchase.

Ocala students said they had been planning to participate.\n\nIn the Parkland shooting, school resource officer Scot Peterson stepped down amid accusations he did not do enough to confront Cruz.

Eric Greitens charged with felony computer tampering", "text": "ST. LOUIS -- St. Louis prosecutors on Friday charged Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens with a felony for his use of a charity donor list for his 2016 political campaign, adding to the first-term governor's legal woes. The charge of tampering with computer data is in addition to an earlier charge alleging Greitens took and transmitted a nonconsensual photo of a partially nude woman with whom he had an extramarital affair in 2015.\n\nThe new charge accuses Greitens of obtaining the donor list from The Mission Continues without permission from the St. Louis-based charity that Greitens founded. He previously paid a small fine to the state Ethics Commission for failing to report the list as a campaign contribution.\n\nGreitens has been facing increasing pressure to resign -- including from fellow Republicans -- since a special House investigative committee's report released April 11 that detailed allegations from the woman with whom he had the affair. She testified that Greitens restrained, slapped, grabbed, shoved and threatened her during a series of sexual encounters that at times left her crying and afraid.\n\nGreitens issued a statement Friday alleging an investigator from the prosecutor's office \"lied under oath and created false evidence.\"\n\n\"Her case is falling apart\u2014so today, she's brought a new one,\" Greitens said. \"By now, everyone knows what this is: this prosecutor will use any charge she can to smear me. Thank goodness for the Constitution and our court system. In the United States of America, you're innocent until proven guilty. In the United States of America, you get your day in court.\"\n\nGreitens has denied committing any crimes and earlier this week vowed to remain in office, calling the investigations into him a \"political witch hunt.\"\n\n\"I will not be resigning the Governor's office. In three weeks, this matter will go to a court of law\u2014where it belongs and where the facts will prove my innocence,\" Greitens said Tuesday. \"Until then, I will do what the people of Missouri sent me here to do: To serve them and work hard on their behalf.\"\n\n\n\nMissouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican whose office has been investigating The Mission Continues, announced Tuesday that he had found evidence to support a felony charge against Greitens, but said it was up to the St. Louis circuit attorney's office to file charges. That office had to move quickly because the statute of limitations was approaching.\n\nGreitens has called Democratic St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner a \"reckless liberal prosecutor\" for leading the investigation that resulted in the invasion-of-privacy charge. His attorneys, in court hearings and filings, have painted a picture of an incompetent prosecutor who rather than working with police to investigate Greitens hired a private investigator who bungled the investigation, hid evidence and lied to the court.\n\nA graphic report by a House investigatory committee made public last week detailed multiple instances in which the woman said Greitens spanked, slapped, grabbed, shoved and called her derogatory names during a series of sexual encounters as he was preparing to run for office in 2015. The testimony contradicts Greitens' previous assertions that \"there was no violence\" and \"no threat of violence\" in what he has described as a consensual extramarital affair.\n\nThe report, signed by all five Republicans and two Democrats on the committee, describes the woman's testimony as credible and notes that Greitens has so far declined to testify or provide documents to the panel. It also outlines instances where the Republican governor's public comments appear to run counter to some of her allegations.\n\nGardner's office began investigating after CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV first reported on the affair on Jan. 10, the day Greitens was giving his annual State of the State speech. The governor acknowledged the affair but denied allegations that he had threatened to release a compromising photo of the woman if she disclosed the relationship. His trial in that case is scheduled to begin May 14.\n\nHawley's office has said that its investigation into The Mission Continues began after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in February that it had it had obtained a copy of an email indicating that a Greitens employee who previously worked at the charity had shared the donor list in January 2015 with Michael Hafner, who had been working for Greitens' gubernatorial exploratory committee, and Danny Laub, Greitens' first campaign manager.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported in October 2016 that Greitens' campaign obtained a list of top donors to The Mission Continues and raised nearly $2 million from donors who were on it. He initially denied to the AP that he had used the donor list for his campaign. But in April 2017, Greitens agreed to pay a $100 fine for failing to report that his gubernatorial campaign had, in fact, received the charity's donor list. Greitens' campaign filed amended finance reports referring to the list as an in-kind contribution valued at $600 and received March 1, 2015, from Laub.\n\nGreitens, a former Navy SEAL officer and Rhodes Scholar, and Hawley both won election in 2016 as maverick political outsiders. Hawley is now running to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, and Democrats have been running TV ads linking Hawley to Greitens. Democrats have criticized Hawley's earlier investigation that found no wrongdoing in Greitens' use of a text message-destroying app, and claimed he stepped up his investigation of the charity only after it became politically beneficial."}, {"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lauren-bush-lauren-gives-birth-to-son-two-days-after-grandmother-barbara-bushs-death/", "published": "2018-04-21T02:49:33", "title": "Lauren Bush Lauren gives birth to son two days after grandmother Barbara Bush's death", "text": "Fashion designer Lauren Bush Lauren and her husband, David Lauren, welcomed their son Max on Thursday, two days after her grandmother Barbara Bush died.

It is the latest step in the agency's ongoing efforts to cast light on some of the darkest parts of own past and on that of its potential future director.\n\nThe memorandum, obtained by CBS News, was written in 2011 by former CIA acting director and CBS News contributor Michael Morell at the request of General David Petraeus, who led the agency at the time. It places responsibility for the destruction of 92 tapes on Jose Rodriguez, Jr., then the head of the agency's directorate of operations, while noting Haspel drafted the cable authorizing the measure.\n\n\"I have found no fault with the performance of Ms. Haspel,\" Morell's report says. \"I have concluded that she acted appropriately in her role as Mr. Rodriguez's Chief of Staff.\"\n\n\"[Haspel] drafted the cable on the direct orders of Mr. Rodriguez; she did not release that cable. It was not her decision to destroy the tapes; it was Mr. Rodriguez's,\" it says.\n\nTwelve of the interrogation tapes, which were destroyed in 2005, were believed to contain footage of the enhanced interrogations of senior al-Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was alleged to have orchestrated the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. Haspel was chief of base at the black site in Thailand when al-Nashiri was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques, including waterboarding.\n\nThe memorandum also says Haspel \"incorrectly\" believed that Rodriguez would obtain approval for releasing the cable from the then-head of the agency, Porter Goss, and followed up with Rodriguez after it had been sent.\n\n\"I have found fault with the performance of Mr. Rodriguez, and I have decided to issue to him a letter of reprimand to remain in his official personnel file for two years,\" Morell writes, though Rodriguez did not face additional sanctions.\n\nHere's the 2011 memo:\n\nIn part, the memo says, this was because Rodriguez had served the agency with distinction for 31 years and had demonstrated candor about why he made the decision to destroy the tapes. Rodriguez has said he acted out of a belief that CIA officers' lives were at risk because some of them were clearly shown in the tapes, and that the world's reaction to leaked, graphic images depicting US Army guards abusing detainees at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison in 2004 reinforced that belief.\n\nThe memo also suggested officials above Rodriguez, and the resulting breakdown in the chain of command, were ultimately blame.\n\n\"The leadership of the Agency failed Mr. Rodriguez,\" it says. \"Because no effort was undertaken by CIA leadership to tackle the issue at the policy level, Mr. Rodriguez was left believing, rightly or wrongly, that he had no other choice but to act on his own authority.\"\n\nThe head of the agency then was Porter Goss, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman who, the report notes, took no action to reprimand Rodriguez at the time. \"This appears to have been a conscious decision on the part of Director Goss,\" the memo says, and that inaction on his part and on that of the White House suggested Rodriguez's actions were not seen \"as insubordination or even a significant error in judgment.\"\n\nGoss is also faulted in the memo for failing to notify congressional oversight committees of the tapes' destruction, which, according to subsequent accounts of the matter, Goss said he intended to do. \"I do not hold Mr. Rodriguez accountable for this failure,\" Morell wrote, \"as it was ultimately the responsibility of the director.\"\n\nThe review memorandum was the result of one of several investigations launched in the aftermath of the tapes' destruction. A nearly three-year criminal investigation, led by special prosecutor John Durham and concluded in 2010, resulted in no charges against Rodriguez, Haspel or any other CIA officer. The accountability report was written after the Justice Department concluded its investigation.\n\nThe CIA has been slowly and systematically pulling back the curtain on Haspel, releasing limited information about the contours of her career and a smattering of her interests, describing her as a polyglot Johnny Cash fan who reads Jane Austen novels and who, over three decades spent in the agency's clandestine service, distinguished herself while serving in some of the most dangerous countries in the world.\n\nBut as more details about Haspel have emerged, so have criticisms of what is still secret. While most members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence have maintained a public ambivalence about how they will vote on Haspel's nomination, several - including Senators Wyden, D-Oregon, Heinrich D-New Mexico and Feinstein, D-California - have expressed impatience and displeasure that repeated requests for more declassified information on Gina's career have gone unanswered. In an April 16 letter - the fifth of its kind sent to CIA, the senators said - they criticized the agency for what they called a \"public relations campaign\" spinning a \"superficial narrative\" about the nominee.\n\n\"In the absence of any meaningful declassification of her career, this public campaign on behalf of Ms. Haspel does a great disservice to the American people, who expect and deserve to understand the backgrounds of their government's leaders,\" they wrote.\n\nThis memorandum's release appears to be part of CIA's efforts to provide a more substantive response. \"At the request of members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and consistent with its commitment to be as transparent as possible, CIA has declassified, with limited redactions, the 2011 disciplinary review memorandum relating to CIA's destruction of tapes,\" said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani.\n\nIn a statement issued after the memo's release, Sen. Wyden called it \"highly incomplete,\" and said it raised, rather than settled, questions about Haspel's involvement. \"The administration needs to release much more information about this episode, including the extensive record described in the Morell report,\" Wyden said.\n\nSen. Feinstein soon followed suit, calling the CIA's selective declassification of material favorable to Haspel \"completely unacceptable.\" \"The CIA has not been forthcoming,\" she said, \"Senators and the public need to know more about her record.\"\n\nBeyond Congress, a movement countering Haspel's nomination has also grown and gained momentum in recent weeks. On Thursday, a group of forty faith, progressive and human rights organizations, including Human Rights First and CODEPINK, sent a letter to congressional leaders urging them to oppose Haspel's nomination. \"[A]ny vote related to her nomination,\" they wrote, \"will be seen as a referendum on torture.\"\n\n\"The problem with something like torture is that words are imperfect tools to convey pain and suffering and anguish,\" said Alberto Mora, former general counsel of the Navy and Marine Corps and a senior fellow of Human Rights First, a signee of the letter. The destruction of the tapes \"prevented the American people and the courts and the congress from understanding the nature of what CIA was engaged in,\" Mora said.\n\nIn a statement provided to CBS News, Morell, who is among a number of former intelligence officials that have come out in public support of Haspel's candidacy, said, \"Ms. Haspel did not destroy the tapes, she did not oversee the destruction of the tapes, and she did not order the destruction of the tapes. She drafted a cable, under instruction from her boss, Mr. Rodriguez, that he sent, under his name and authority, ordering that the tapes be destroyed. Mr. Rodriguez ordered the destruction of the tapes, not Ms. Haspel,\" Morell said. \"My decision on the question of accountability was that Mr. Rodriguez was who should be held accountable and reprimanded,\" he said.\n\nMorell also said his report was shared with both the White House and Congress at the time it was submitted. \"There were no follow-up questions from either,\" he said.\n\nRodriguez, in a statement posted on his own website, said, \"I have consistently taken full responsibility for the destruction of interrogation tapes from the very beginning,\" noting he had given interviews to 60 Minutes and other documentaries on the matter and detailed his decision in his own book.\n\n\"My primary motivation in ordering the destruction of the tapes was to do what many in the intelligence community and the White House had failed to do at the time: protect the identities of the CIA personnel whose faces were seen on those tapes.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever gave me an order not to destroy them,\" Rodriguez wrote, \"I did what no one else in government was willing to risk doing.\""}, {"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-ready-to-resume-nuke-program-if-us-leaves-deal-foreign-minister-warns/", "published": "2018-04-20T22:13:29", "title": "Iran \"ready\" to resume nuke program if US leaves deal, foreign minister warns", "text": "In an interview to air Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says the country is ready to restart its controversial nuclear program if the Trump administration resumes sanctions.\n\n\"We have put a number of options for ourselves, and those options are ready,\" Zarif told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan, \"including options that would involve resuming at a much greater speed our nuclear activities.\"\n\nZarif's comments to \"Face the Nation\" expand those of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who earlier this month said, \"we will not be the first to violate the accord, but they should definitely know that they will regret it if they violate it.\"\n\nThe top Iranian diplomat worked for two years with Obama administration negotiators to reach an agreement to freeze Iran's nuclear development.

But Army leaders said the service has been able to encourage more experienced service members to stay on the job to satisfy a growing demand for troops.\n\nArmy Sgt. Maj. Daniel Dailey said Friday that the updated goal will be 76,500. Six months into the recruiting year, the service has brought in just 28,000 new soldiers.\n\nDailey said the goal is to grow the Army to 483,500, as approved by Congress, and it's up to the Army whether to use more recruiting or re-enlistment. He said that retaining current soldiers has been more successful this year than in the past, with 86 percent staying on, compared with 81 percent in previous years.\n\nArmy Secretary Mark Esper said there is a mismatch between the number of soldiers in the Army and the demand for more troops, and acknowledged that the \"strong economy does make it challenging.\" He said, however, that the Army will not sacrifice quality for quantity and that standards will not be lowered to meet recruiting goals.\n\nThe struggle to meet this year's higher recruiting numbers - a significant increase over last year's mission of 69,000 - was expected, mainly due to the favorable American economy and increased competition from private sector employers who are able to pay graduates more money.\n\nMaj. Gen. Jeff Snow, head of the Army's recruiting command, predicted late last year that the higher enlistment goal would be difficult to meet, considering economic factors and the military's need for recruits to pass strict physical testing that many young people can't complete.\n\n\"This mission is going to be a significant challenge for the command,\" he told The Associated Press in December. Meeting the increased mission this year, Snow said, could force the Army to take in more recruits who would require waivers for marijuana use, low test scores or other more basic health issues.\n\nAsked if the Army has approved more waivers so far this year, Esper and Dailey said they didn't know totals. The Army has historically kept and provided detailed data on waivers.\n\n\"The numbers don't tell the whole story,\" Dailey said, adding that waivers require the Army to take a closer look at a recruit who may have had a legal problem when they were younger, smoked pot, or has had some type of heath problem. The issue could range from simple colorblindness to an arrest.\n\nBut in December, Snow said his goal for 2017 was to have fewer than 2 percent of the new recruits be considered \"category four,\" meaning they scored 31 or less, out of 99, on the aptitude test. Esper said Friday that he had directed that the Army not exceed the 2 percent limit, even though the Defense Department allows up to 4 percent.\n\nMilitary leaders have increasingly warned of recruiting challenges, noting that lower unemployment, a strong economy and the declining quality of the youth market have steadily shrunk the number of young people considered eligible to be recruits.\n\nDefense officials have also complained that despite the last 16 years of war in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the American public is increasingly disconnected from the military, and they say many people have misperceptions about serving and often don't personally know any service members.\n\nThis time of year is usually the toughest for military recruiters, since this is the period when high school seniors start getting acceptance letters from colleges."}, {"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/another-shooting-in-florida-as-students-walk-out-demanding-action-on-gun-control/", "published": "2018-04-20T22:12:28", "title": "Another shooting in Florida, as students walk out demanding action on gun control", "text": "NEW YORK -- Thousands of students nationwide walked out of class to protest gun violence Friday, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, which left 13 dead in Colorado.

In 2015, Congress legalized the export of U.S. crude, he said. As much as 10 percent of the total U.S. consumption of gasoline leaves the country in exports, he said.\n\nA block in crude exports would be in line with other trade policies advocated by Trump, he said. The U.S. has during recent years increased its production capability so that it is now the world's third largest oil producer behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The oil companies wouldn't like it,\" DeHaan said. \"But limiting crude exports would allow more for use in the U.S., potentially lowering prices.\"\n\nOil prices have risen steadily since falling to just over $30 a barrel in early 2016. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, fell on Friday to $68.13 per barrel; Brent crude, used in international markets, also declined. Energy stocks slumped as well.\n\nAnother way the U.S. could try to push down oil prices would be for the Environmental Protection Agency to ease restrictions on the use of ethanol in gasoline products, DeHaan said. Again, this would not be contrary to other initiatives from the Trump administration. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been active in rolling back environmental regulations across a broad range of areas.\n\nTrump could also back off from his call to unwind vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, DeHaan said. \"More efficient cars mean consumers use less gasoline, which over the long-term could reduce prices,\" he said.\n\nAny call to provide subsidies to oil producers or open lands for production might also lower prices. \"It's unlikely that Trump would actually do this,\" McKay said. \"But if he did, the markets would react rather quickly.\"\n\nHigher oil prices translate to increased costs at the pump for U.S. households and businesses and stoke fears of inflation. For every penny the price of gas increases, it costs consumers about $4 million a day. That equates to $1.4 billion a year, DeHaan said.\n\n\"A jump in oil prices preceded nearly every one of the prior downturns in the U.S. economy, and was the primary cause for a number of them,\" TD Securities analysts said in a research note.\n\nThe national gas price average rose to $2.71 a gallon earlier this week, its highest level since the summer of 2015, according to AAA. The price is 30 cents higher than it was this time last year, AAA said on its website. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that motorists this summer will pay an average of $2.74 for a gallon of regular gas, which would be the highest price for the busy driving season since 2014.\n\nHigher gas prices have a chilling affect on consumer confidence, DeHaan said. \"Consumers drive by maybe four or five gas stations a day,\" he said. \"When they are barraged by higher gas prices it makes them less optimistic. Psychologically it's bad for the economy.\""}, {"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/air-pollution-worst-us-cities-2018/", "published": "2017-04-19T16:12:20", "title": "U.S. cities with the worst air pollution", "text": ""}, {"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/temple-university-alpha-epsilon-pi-fraternity-suspended-sexual-assault-underage-drinking-reports-2018-04-20/", "published": "2018-04-20T20:27:13", "title": "Temple University suspends fraternity over reports of sexual assault, underage drinking", "text": "Temple University has suspended fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi while it investigates \"credible reports\" of sexual assault, underage drinking and possible drug use, the Philadelphia university said in a statement Friday.

Two federal deputy marshals arrested Riess, 56, about 8:30 p.m. Thursday at a restaurant in South Padre Island, Texas, the agency earlier said in a statement.\n\nSouth Padre Island is a beach resort community 27 miles from the crossing into Mexico.\n\nCity spokeswoman Angelique Soto said Friday that a witness called authorities saying a woman matching Riess' description was at the restaurant.

That was our main concern. We ran a killer off the streets.\"\n\nRiess had been on the run since at least late March when her husband, 54-year-old David Riess, was found fatally shot at their home in Blooming Prairie, Minnesota.

Authorities found David Riess' body inside his home with multiple gunshots.\n\nThey were not able to determine how long he had been dead and could not find his wife. They learned Lois Riess may have been at the casino in Iowa, but she wasn't there when they went looking for her.\n\nFrom there, investigators believed she went to Florida where she killed 59-year-old Pamela Hutchinson of Bradenton, Florida.\n\nAuthorities were called to Fort Myers Beach on April 9 and found Hutchinson dead, with gunshot wounds. Investigators believe Riess used the same gun to kill her husband and Hutchinson, and that she killed the woman to assume her identity.\n\nSurveillance video showed Riess smiling and talking with Hutchinson on April 5 at a brewery in Fort Myers Beach. Authorities say she may have targeted Hutchinson because the two women looked alike.\n\nHutchinson had moved to Florida last year from Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nScott Rose, the sheriff of Dodge County, Minnesota, said at a press conference later Friday that that both Riess' and Hutchinson's passport information had been flagged to border authorities, so it was unlikely she would have been able to cross into Mexico. He thanked the media and said the publicity helped lead to Riess' arrest.\n\n\"From a media standpoint, we couldn't have done this without you guys,\" Rose said. \"The amount of coverage we had nationwide is why she was arrested last night.\"\n\nRose said he was \"relieved\" to learn of the arrest in Texas.\n\n\"We were concerned for the public's safety because of her actions in Florida and obviously there was a concern about her coming back here as well,\" Rose said.\n\nRiess is being held in the South Padre Island jail. Rose said it was likely Riess would first be extradited to Florida, because charges there have already been filed. He said prosecutors in Minnesota and Florida were working together to coordinate prosecution.\n\nMinnesota court records show that Riess was suspended as guardian for her disabled 61-year-old sister after a report that she had been transferring funds from a guardianship account to her own account, then withdrawing funds at a casino.\n\nA 2015 affidavit said thousands of dollars had been spent at Diamond Jo Casino in northern Iowa, not far from Riess' Blooming Prairie home.

On Friday the 69-year-old heir to the British throne got another position to wait for -- he was approved as the next head of the 53-nation Commonwealth of the U.K. and its former colonies.\n\nCommonwealth leaders meeting in London confirmed in a statement that the next chief of the group \"shall be His Royal Highness Prince Charles, The Prince of Wales.\" That won't happen until he succeeds his mother on the throne when she dies.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said the decision was unanimous, but it had not been a foregone conclusion. Elizabeth, who turns 92 on Saturday, has led the Commonwealth since she became queen in 1952. However, the position is not hereditary, and some people have suggested a non-royal leader would give the group a more modern profile.\n\nBut any opposition was nipped in the bud by an intervention from the queen, who told the gathered leaders on Thursday it was her \"sincere wish\" that Charles would one day carry on her Commonwealth work.\n\nLeaders including Britain's Theresa May and Canada's Justin Trudeau chimed in to say they agreed with the queen.\n\nMay told reporters on Friday that Charles was \"a proud supporter of the Commonwealth,\" and \"it is fitting that one day he will continue the work of his mother.\"\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThe position is largely symbolic, but the queen's commitment has been a major force behind the survival of the Commonwealth. She has visited almost every member country, often multiple times, over her 66-year reign.\n\nCharles is almost as well-traveled as his mother, and is a longtime champion of environmental causes, a priority for the Commonwealth. Its members include small island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific that are among the countries most vulnerable to rising seas, fiercer storms and other effects of global climate change.\n\nLeaders at the meeting signed a \"blue charter\" to protect the world's oceans and committed to stronger cybersecurity and freer trade.\n\nBritain has tried to use the biennial heads of government meeting to reinvigorate a disparate group that takes in 2.4 billion people in countries from giant India to tiny Tuvalu, and has struggled to carve out a firm place on the world stage.\n\nThe next summit, in 2020, will be held in Rwanda, which was never a British colony but has been persuaded to join the club. Former Portuguese colony Mozambique is also a Commonwealth member, and Togo is considering joining.\n\nBritish officials have been paying more attention to the Commonwealth since the U.K. voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. The government insists Brexit will not lead to isolationism but to an outward-looking \"global Britain\" -- and the Commonwealth could provide a platform for British diplomatic and cultural clout outside the EU.\n\nBritain laid on a lavish royal welcome for Commonwealth leaders, including a banquet at Buckingham Palace, the use of Windsor Castle for meetings and the deployment of royal glamour couple Prince Harry Meghan Markle to a series of events.\n\nBut the summit was overshadowed by uproar over the treatment by U.K. immigration authorities of some long-term British residents from the Caribbean.\n\nMay and other government ministers have apologized repeatedly after it emerged that some people who settled in the U.K. in the decades after World War II had recently been refused medical care or threatened with deportation because they could not produce paperwork to show their right to reside in Britain.\n\nThe government says they accidentally fell afoul of new measures intended to clamp down on illegal immigration. But opposition politicians say the treatment of the \"Windrush generation\" -- named for the ship Empire Windrush, which brought the first big group of post-war Caribbean immigrants to Britain in 1948 -- is cause for national shame.\n\nMay said Friday that Britain would do \"whatever it takes\" -- including paying compensation -- to make amends.\n\n\"These people are British,\" she said. \"They are part of us.

You guys exaggerated that call. That was a big exaggeration. We're not babies.\"\n\nMr Comey's memos tell a different story.\n\nIn one, written minutes after a visit to the White House on February 14, Mr Comey paints a picture of a president in high agitation over the leaks against him.\n\n\"He then reviewed in some detail the leaks of his calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, including how the calls had gone, how he assumed that calls he made on 'this beautiful phone [touching the grey phone on the desk]' were confidential, how it couldn't have come from the Mexicans or Australians, how the transcripts actually included things he doesn't remember saying ['and they say I have one of the world's greatest memories'],\" the memo says.\n\nAccording to the Comey account, Mr Trump was desperate to know who had divulged the details of his conversations not once \u2014 with Mr Turnbull \u2014 but twice, by leaking the talking points of his testy call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto the same day.\n\n\"It makes us look terrible to have these things leaking,\" Mr Comey recalls an anguished Mr Trump telling him. \"I tried to interject several times to agree with him about the leaks being terrible, but was unsuccessful. When he finished, I said I agreed very much that it was terrible that his calls with foreign leaders leaked.\"\n\nAt the time, Mr Trump and his then-advisers Steve Bannon, Mike Flynn, Reince Priebus, Stephen Miller and were rattled by a feared \"deep state\" element within the wider Washington bureaucracy \u2014 an unspecified and unknown cabal of officials who may not have the best interests of the elected government at heart.\n\nMr Comey's memos certainly confirm that the White House harboured no suspicions that the Australian or Mexican governments had leaked, and that if the leakers in the US could not be identified, then Mr Trump would like to have seen journalists cough up their names.\n\n\"He [Mr Trump] replied by saying it may involve putting reporters in jail. They spend a couple of days in jail, make a new friend, and they are ready to talk,\" Mr Comey recalls.\n\nTo this day, Mr Trump disputes almost everything Mr Comey has written or said about those turbulent three months from January to May when Mr Comey ran the bureau.\n\nAfter the release of the memos, Mr Trump tweeted:\n\n\"\u2026Shadey (sic) James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don't think so!\"\n\nThe 'golden showers thing'\n\nIf Mr Trump was vexed by leaks of his Oval Office conversations on that \"beautiful phone\" on his Resolute Desk, he was completely unnerved by what Mr Comey may have known about his alleged dealings with Russia, its leaders and its prostitutes.\n\nHe had questioned Mr Comey about his knowledge of the contents of an unconfirmed dossier which, among other things, claims Mr Trump had watched as two Russian prostitutes urinated on each other on a bed in the Presidential Suite of Moscow's Ritz-Carlton Hotel in 2013.\n\n\"There were no prostitutes, there were never prostitutes,\" a Comey memo from early January quotes Mr Trump saying. \"He then said something about him being the kind of guy who didn't need to \"go there\" and laughed (which I understood to be communicating that he didn't need to pay for sex). He said '2013' to himself, as if trying to remember that period of time, but didn't add anything\"\n\nIt was a subject Mr Trump returned to a couple of weeks later over an intimate dinner alone with Mr Comey in the Green Room of the White House \u2014 again, captured in granular detail by another of Mr Comey's memos.\n\nThe Comey record suggestions Mr Trump did most of the talking as the FBI director struggled with the structure of the conversation: \"It really was conversation-as-jigsaw-puzzle in a way, with pieces picked up, then discarded, then returned to.\"\n\nAt some point in the 1 hour and 20 minute encounter, the matter of paying Russian women for lewd acts was picked up and returned to.\n\n\"He turned to what he called the 'golden showers thing' and recounted much of what he had said previously on that topic,\" the memo said. \"He repeated that it was a complete fabrication and 'fake news'\u2026 he said it bothered him if his wife thought there was even a 1 per cent chance it was true in any respect \u2026 he said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.\"\n\nHistory, and Mr Comey's much-publicised book A Higher Loyalty, will record that no FBI investigation was ever held, because the White House accepted Mr Comey's eminently sensible advice that it might not be a good look for the American public to find out their President's private bedroom conduct \u2014 real or alleged \u2014 was the subject of a federal inquiry.\n\nComey is gone, but the fight goes on\n\nThe spectacle of Mr Comey hawking his book and reflecting on Mr Trump's moral authority to lead has fed not so much a national conversation as a partisan screeching match across the US this last week \u2014 and it will not abate.\n\nMake no mistake \u2014 Mr Trump is giving as good as he gets.\n\nFar from being cowed or embarrassed, Mr Trump's advisers have let it be known that they believe Mr Trump has \"weathered the storm\" stirred by the Comey publications \u2014 which has again brought Mr Trump's brand of plucky pugilism to the fore.\n\nThe \"witch hunt\" won't be over until the mother of all investigations surrounding the Trump family and its 2016 campaign contacts with Russia is over.\n\nThat investigation, led by veteran FBI director Robert Mueller, is reaching a critical final phase and confronting a pivotal question \u2014 whether Mr Trump himself should be interviewed under oath.\n\nMr Trump protests his innocence over Russian collusion at every turn and nothing in the Comey memos or his book comes close to the standard of evidence required to make a charge against Mr Trump.\n\nEven so, most of Mr Trump's first 15 months in office have been shaded by what he called the \"cloud\" of allegations hanging above him and he vents his frustration almost daily.\n\nMustering the deep financial resources at his disposal, Mr Trump has now bolstered his small army of personal lawyers to try to see off the Mueller probe.\n\nThe week ended with the addition of his old friend and former New York mayor Rudy Guiliani, and Florida-based attorneys Jane and Martin Raskin.\n\nMr Guiliani has a goal to try to guide the Mueller investigation towards an end within weeks which, by general consensus, is considered an ambitious timeline.\n\nMr Trump appears to have seen off the worst of the dangers presented by Mr Comey, but the \"cloud\" he has governed beneath will hang heavy over the White House until all his legal woes are dealt with.\n\nTopics: world-politics, politics-and-government, government-and-politics, foreign-affairs, united-states, australia\n\nFirst posted"}, {"link": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-21/north-korea-says-it-will-suspend-nuclear-and-missile-testing/9683386", "published": "2018-04-20T22:33:13", "title": "North Korea says it will stop nuclear tests and abolish test site;

But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \"denuclearisation\" that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops from the peninsula.\n\nTensions eased significantly after, in a New Year's speech, Mr Kim called for lower military tensions and improved ties with South Korea.\n\nIt sent a delegation to the Winter Olympics held in South Korea and agreed to meet with Mr Moon and Mr Trump to discuss denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe ruling party's plenary meeting on Friday was convened to discuss \"policy issues of a new stage\" to meet the demands of the current \"important historic period,\" the KCNA said.\n\nAP/Reuters\n\nTopics: unrest-conflict-and-war, world-politics, information-and-communication, korea-republic-of, korea-democratic-peoples-republic-of\n\nFirst posted"}, {"link": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-21/neighbour-spoke-to-explosion-victim-minutes-before-his-death/9683694", "published": "2018-04-21T04:11:20", "title": "Explosion victim spoke to neighbours minutes before his death", "text": "Explosion victim spoke to neighbours minutes before his death\n\nUpdated\n\nA neighbour and her three children were talking to a man minutes before a gas cylinder exploded and killed him, north of Brisbane, on Friday afternoon.\n\nEmergency services said the man in his fifties was killed when a gas cylinder exploded in his backyard in Warner, making a loud bang that was heard across a wide area.\n\nRic Hartman, whose wife and kids were talking to the victim shortly beforehand, said he heard the explosion as he worked in his home office.\n\n\"There was a massive explosion, nothing like I can explain in terms of the sound and the intensity,\" Mr Hartman said.\n\n\"I jumped up, tried to find out what the cause was and then I saw our neighbour through the window who was lying on the ground, obviously in a very bad way.\"\n\nMr Hartman rang emergency services and directed them to the scene, as the man's family were not at the house at the time.\n\n\"My wife and three children were out talking to him about five minutes before it happened,\" he said.\n\nMr Hartman described the man as a kind-hearted builder who worked and did well by his family.\n\n\"It's pretty close to home and obviously very tragic for their family,\" he said.\n\n\"We've been here for 15 years, they've been here longer.

Atrocious behaviour. No concern about consequences.\n\nThis week was consequential. The political environment around the commission has changed.\n\nThe Government that blustered about the worthless nature of the probe \u2014 when it was mooted by backbench renegades and their political rivals \u2014 is now pushing legislation for increased penalties for corporate crime.\n\nThat's for down the track.\n\nAMP's trail of blunders\n\nFor now, here's just some examples of where you \u2014 the customer \u2014 stand in the multi-billion-dollar world of financial planning and wealth management.\n\nAMP was aware it had been charging customers \"fee for no service\" \u2014 money they weren't entitled to.\n\nCatherine Brenner, the chairwoman of AMP, jumped in to make changes to an apparently independent report by law firm Clayton Utz that was being prepared to give to the regulator and she asked for the chief executive's name to be taken out of it.\n\nThe email, reflecting her intention, said this: \"Include a statement to the effect that [chief executive] Craig Meller was unaware of the practices or their illegality.\"\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, AMP also admitted they made false or misleading statements to the regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) 20 times.\n\nAn internal AMP report said letting customers know they were paying junk fees could lead to calls for compensation and problems with the regulator. Taking the money was okay, but informing punters, \"would be a very negative customer experience\".\n\nEven after fessing up to the regulator in the independent report, even after they'd paid back the money, AMP couldn't stop lying to their customers. A script for use in call centres showed workers were told to tell customers \u2014 asking about the refunded fees appearing in their accounts \u2014 that it was an \"administrative error\". It wasn't.\n\nDead people charged by CBA\n\nEven death wouldn't stop the Commonwealth Bank taking fees from customers, charges it wasn't even entitled to if they'd been alive. A morbid angle to the \"fee for no service\" scandal, from one lucrative late customer, Australia's biggest bank took fees for a decade.\n\nThey received complaints about it for four years and sat on internal and external reports about it for two more years, before deigning to inform the regulator.\n\nThey had to pay back $118 million, out of more than $200 million in compensation from the Big Four banks and AMP on this issue.\n\nANZ logged 56 events of \"improper conduct\" in their financial planning and wealth management arm: forged signatures, impersonation of customers, fraudulent use of power of attorney, false witnessing of documents, customer's funds transferred to advisers' personal accounts. Expect more on that next week.\n\nTo finish, consider these examples from the week:\n\nA retired couple wanted a low-risk investment. The adviser \"put them in high-risk investments\" which lost their money fast. When they tried to fortress their remaining assets, the adviser couldn't be contacted \u2026 for a year\n\nA customer was charged premium fees for a managed investment account. Where was the money really being held? In a \"zero-growth cash account for 10 years\"\n\nOnce the fee-for-no-service scandal was uncovered, one unnamed institution didn't want to refund the money they'd stolen. They wanted an \"opt-in\" compensation scheme. That means customers, unaware they'd had fees taken out of their account for no service, would have to \"apply\" to get their money back.\n\nIf you ever wondered what the institutions think of you,

cases and [the] recent one in the UK appear to be the first reported that are resistant to all of the antibiotics that have been in routine use against gonorrhoea,\" Professor Murphy said.\n\nThe Australians' infections have so far been resistant to ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin and tetracycline, according to PHE.\n\n\"These cases will be challenging for healthcare professionals to manage,\" PHE said.\n\nOne of the Australians is believed to have caught the infection having sex in South-East Asia, while the other has not recently travelled overseas, PHE said.\n\nProfessor Murphy said authorities were working to determine where the infection was acquired.\n\nHe urged people to prevent the spread of gonorrhoea by practising safe sex, using barrier protection like condoms and dams with all types of sexual activity.\n\nSymptoms of gonorrhoea include abnormal discharge, genital and anal pain, and a sore, dry throat in both men and women.\n\nPeople who experience symptoms have been advised to visit their GP or sexual health clinic as soon as possible.\n\nTopics: mens-health, health, sexual-health, sexually-transmitted-diseases,

mother\n\nUpdated\n\nWhen So was 13, she was stolen from her Vietnamese mountain town and sold in China. Just months before, her mother Do had sold herself across the border to save her life.\n\nAt 13, most children are starting high school, but not So. Already independent, she packed her bags and left her small mountain village to work in Sapa town, a thriving tourist hub in north Vietnam.\n\nSo found a job working illegally at a noodle shop, rented a room and felt free and excited in her region's only urban hotspot.\n\nBut after just two months, she was gone \u2014 one of a growing number of Vietnamese women trafficked to China, a path her mother Do had taken only three months before.\n\n\"My friend Sa and I met two boys at the lake in town,\" So explains, almost two years later. \"I'd never met one of the boys before but the other guy was Sa's boyfriend so it seemed OK to go together.\"\n\nSo and Sa saw no issue in hopping on the back of two motorbikes with their new friends. They'd be back in Sapa before nightfall.\n\nIt wasn't until So's driver turned off the main road into a forest that she began to feel nervous.\n\n\"He had one hand driving and one hand texting,\" says So.\n\n\"I asked him 'where are we?' and I asked him to stop, but he didn't.\"\n\nEventually the motorbikes slowed \u2014 they had reached a river. The Red River, winding the length of Lao Cai's border with China's Yunnan province, is a notorious crossing for traffickers. On the other side, the men who would receive the young girls were waiting.\n\nStolen, sold, rarely returned\n\nAt least 100 girls are repatriated to Lao Cai province from China every year, but many more are stolen, sold and never returned.\n\nLao Cai, one of the poorest, most isolated and most ethnically diverse provinces in Vietnam, is a prime spot for traffickers.\n\nThere are few statistics available that show exactly how many women and girls like So are trafficked to China every year, but the issue is on the rise all over Vietnam. Whether they are kidnapped or tricked with the promise of love or a better life, girls as young as 13 are sold across the border as sex workers, factory workers or, increasingly, brides.\n\nSold as a slave\n\nSo's trafficker manhandled her down to the water and the two girls were forced to wade across in the darkness.\n\n\"On the other side, two guys held me and Sa and the other two guys went to the bushes to pay each other,\" says So. \"That's when I felt really scared. They had taken my phone and my money so I had no way to call for help.\n\n\"One guy said 'if you don't stay here, I'll kill you. I've killed many people before, do you want to go down to have a look?'\"\n\nThe girls were forced onto motorbikes, sandwiched between their Chinese buyers and Vietnamese traffickers.\n\n\"They took us to a house where we stayed for a night and in the morning, they brought a dress for Sa and put her in high heels,\" says So. \"I never saw her again.\"\n\nSo was sold three times in China, travelling more than 1,800km to Nanyang, an industrial city in the north-west of the country. Too young to be married off, she was bought as a \"daughter\" for a couple who lived in a 15th floor apartment.\n\n\"I couldn't speak Chinese so I could only communicate in sign language,\" says So. \"I felt so isolated. My only freedom was when I was asked to empty the trash.\"\n\nSo's \"father\" was an alcoholic and when his wife went out, he became very suggestive.\n\n\"I began to be frightened for my own safety. I knew I needed an escape plan.\"\n\nSo's great escape\n\nSo made as much rubbish as she could, filling up the bins, and suggested she take them down to the street.\n\n\"He was watching from the balcony as I went down,\" So remembers.\n\nShe had no money but she knew this might be her only chance so she ran, eventually taking refuge in a small, bustling supermarket. She knew her \"mother\" and \"father\" would be looking for her.\n\nThat night, some Chinese people found her and took her to the police.\n\nAfter two months at the police station, So was returned to Vietnam.\n\nFrom mother to daughter\n\nIn the north of Vietnam most victims are young teens like So, according to Australian NGO, The Blue Dragon Children's Foundation. But in some cases, parents are the ones being trafficked. So's mother, Do, offered herself to traffickers, desperate to escape to what she hoped would be a better life.\n\nSo's father was an abusive opium addict; the situation came to a head when he beat Do so badly that he broke her jaw. Do pushed for a divorce for six months but finally saw no option but to run, leaving her daughters with a local NGO for their safety.\n\n\"I asked some friends to help me to go, then we went to the border and just crossed over,\" Do says.\n\n\"My sister in China paid [traffickers] for bringing me there to cover the bus fare. They didn't sell me.\"\n\nUnlike most trafficking victims, Do was able to choose from a line of potential husbands who came to her sister's house. She was sold to the man of her choice and now lives with him in China.\n\nChina \u2014 a promised land\n\nDo says that she would never recommend doing what she did, but many Vietnamese still see China as an escape route, especially older women fleeing abuse or abject poverty.\n\nAccording to the Blue Dragon Children's Foundation, there is a misconception across Vietnam about what life is like in China and some trafficked women go willingly at first, tricked by the promise of work or opportunity.\n\n\"[Some] victims \u2026 believe false promises, for example one case where the victim agreed to go with her friend for a job in Korea,\" says Le Thi Hong Luong, Blue Dragon anti-trafficking coordinator. \"They applied for a visa, they had a passport, they travelled by plane, but of course they stopped in China.\"\n\nTwo different worlds\n\nYoung women are trafficked to China from all over Vietnam, but the issue is particularly rife in Sapa.\n\nThe town was a well-kept secret before Vietnam's Doi Moi reforms opened its doors to international tourism and trade in 1986.\n\nToday, it is a tourist hotspot, with visits rising 32 per cent in 2015-16. But Sapa's ethnic minority groups still live traditional lives, especially So's people, the Hmong.\n\nThis lack of cultural integration is what puts Hmong women at particular risk of trafficking, according to Mr Hoolihan.\n\n\"You've got a population that have lived, because of their nomadic history, in self-contained small communities and \u2026 always assumed that society is safe.\n\n\"That is becoming less relevant as Sapa grows and changes.\"\n\nETHOS, a tour company supporting marginalised minority groups in Lao Cai, organises regular anti-trafficking workshops with the Sapa District Women's Union.\n\nDemand for trafficked brides is rising, as China's one-child policy and Confucian preference for male children has left it with a deficit of women.\n\n30 to 40 million Chinese men will be unable to find brides from their own country by 2020, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nMost young girls in Sapa are aware of trafficking, but according to ETHOS, have little concept of how to protect themselves. Almost all have smartphones and use social media, and most are not wary when meeting new people online.\n\nThe issue is made more complex by the Hmong tradition of marrying young \u2014 children in year 9 are already thinking about finding a spouse and traffickers prey on their naivety.\n\n\"They're are young, easily influenced teenagers,\" Mr Hoolihan says, \"they are following their hearts and not their heads.\"\n\nAt the most recent anti-trafficking workshop, almost all the girls knew someone who had been trafficked through an online boyfriend or fiance.\n\nOpportunistic traffickers will even use the loss of one girl to trick the next one. A few days after So was stolen, her sister, My, hung posters with the help of the team at ETHOS.\n\nEventually someone called My.\n\n\"He said, 'you want to come to Lao Cai to meet your sister?',\" My remembers.\n\n\"He had no leads,\" Mr Hoolihan adds. \"He knew that she was the older sister and wanted to use her vulnerability to trick her into going.\"\n\nIn many cases, Hmong parents are just as unaware about the risks of trafficking as their children, having grown up in a very different world.\n\nIn Hmong culture, children are independent at a young age, so most parents see no issue with allowing their daughters to live and work in town. What's more, many do not know how to operate smartphones or what social media is.\n\nThe Trung family lost their 17 year-old daughter Nhu almost four years ago. They kept Nhu away from Sapa town, but even in the village she was constantly meeting people through her smartphone.\n\n\"She was always on the phone and we were worried for her because she played with a lot of boys,\" says Mrs Trung. \"We didn't know what to do.\"\n\n\"We were all at a party that day and then she was gone,\" says Mrs Trung, who has regained contact with her stolen daughter.\n\n\"She met a young man at the lake in Sapa town and doesn't remember anything after that.\"\n\nMothers fight back\n\nCo is one of a new generation of mothers taking a proactive approach to trafficking. Many young Hmong mothers worked in town when they were younger and have watched Sapa change into the bustling, unpredictable town it is today.\n\nCo volunteers at the ETHOS anti-trafficking workshops with a number of other local women, but her main focus is on her own daughter.\n\n\"When she's 13, 14, 15 I will be very worried about her,\" says Co. \"I think the best way [to protect her] is just to let her go to study and she [won't] have a lot of time to go out.\"\n\nMost of Co's peers also believe the solution is to keep their daughters at home.\n\n\"When you live in the village there are not many problems,\" says Co, \"[but] when they go to the town to work \u2026 they go out a lot \u2014 nobody tells them don't go out or meet other people.\"\n\nAwareness about bride trafficking is spreading in Lao Cai but there is still a long way to go \u2014 women and girls continue to disappear and most never come back.\n\nCredits\n\nWords and photos by freelance correspondent Zoe Osborne\n\nEdited and produced by Annika Blau\n\nTopics: women, womens-status, domestic-violence, human-trafficking, human, vietnam\n\nFirst posted"}, {"link": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-21/afl-scorecentre/9673540", "published": "2018-04-21T03:10:45", "title": "Saints v Giants, Blues v Eagles, Power v Cats, Dockers v Bulldogs: AFL round five live scores, stats and commentary", "text": "Saints v Giants, Blues v Eagles, Power v Cats, Dockers v Bulldogs: AFL round five live scores, stats and commentary\n\nPosted\n\nSt Kilda has a tough test against GWS to kick off an AFL Saturday, then Carlton will host West Coast before Port Adelaide faces Geelong at home and the Dockers and Dogs go at it in Perth.

It wasn't just meant for the gratification of men.\"\n\nShare Digging at the Hierakonpolis Expedition in Egypt.\n\nFor over two decades, Dr Friedman has directed the Hierakonpolis Expedition in Egypt, at the site of a vast predynastic city under the sand \u2014 one of the biggest urban centres of its time, in around 3600 BC.\n\nNow armed with new tools and techniques, her team have been shedding fresh light on the extraordinary findings at the site.\n\n\"Infrared radiation is heat radiation, and it's very difficult to properly image the mummies without simultaneously cooking them,\" said Aaron Deter-Wolf, prehistoric archaeologist and author of Ancient Ink: The Archaeology of Tattooing.\n\n\"That's bad science, right? No one wants to cook the mummy!\"\n\nHowever digital infrared cameras and imaging have changed that, allowing archaeologists to see things they couldn't before.\n\n\"It's a completely non-destructive process. We have the ability, with a stroke of a button, to change our understanding of tattooing in ancient Egypt,\" Mr Deter-Wolf said.\n\nWhy did ancient humans tattoo themselves?\n\nThe latest findings from Dr Friedman and her colleagues, recently published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, represent the oldest evidence so far of tattooing in Egypt.\n\nRemarkably, Gebelein Man and Woman are contemporaries of the oldest tattooed mummy found in the world, from a very different culture and location.\n\nOtzi the Iceman melted out of a glacial ice sheet in the Alps at the Italo-Austrian border, and was found by hikers in 1992. His remains are carbon dated to between 3370-3100 BC.\n\nOtzi has an extraordinary array of tattoos \u2014 61 groups of symbols in total \u2014 mainly along his joints, spine and left wrist.\n\nShare The oldest tattooed mummy ever found, Otzi, melted out of a glacial ice sheet in 1992.\n\nX-rays have revealed his tattoos were placed at locations where he suffered from arthritis and other ailments.\n\n\"A number of his marks seem to correspond to traditional Chinese acupuncture meridians,\" Mr Deter-Wolf said.\n\n\"This reinforced the idea that perhaps these tattoos were applied as a medicinal or therapeutic practice.\"\n\nThis possibility is still debated.\n\nRich in meaning\n\nAccording to Mr Deter-Wolf, tattoos are potent evidence of what scientists describe as \"behaviourally modern\" humans.\n\n\"The desire to decorate the body implies there is complex symbolism, the presence of language, and a social network in which people have value in appearing other than they are naturally,\" he said.\n\n\"As a species, the reason we would do that, is that it improves our standing \u2014 it shows people how we want to be perceived.\"\n\nShare Archaeologist Aaron Deter-Wolf in the field.\n\nArchaeologists believe tattoos carried deep spiritual and ritual significance in ancient societies.\n\n\"When you consider that it might have also been a death sentence \u2014there were no antibiotics if you got an infection \u2014 it was a big deal to be tattooed then,\" Dr Friedman said.\n\n\"It wasn't just what you did after a few beers and before a curry.\"\n\nIn addition to tattoos on preserved mummies, the evidence for ancient tattoos is found in the imagery on pottery and other objects.\n\nBut there's a third source of evidence that has gone mostly unnoticed \u2014 until now.\n\nTools for tattoos\n\nMr Deter-Wolf lives in the country music capital of the world: Nashville, Tennessee. But his own tattoos are inspired by another tribe.\n\nOne of them he's even inscribed on himself, using a needle handmade out of a deer bone.\n\nShare Archaeologists have recreated the tools ancient humans used to tattoo their skin.\n\nBut he's not a tattooist or DIY body modification maverick \u2014 this is experimental archaeology at work.\n\nMr Deter-Wolf studies Native American sites with the Tennessee Division of Archaeology, and has a special interest in the origins of ancient tattoos.\n\nAnd where there are tattoos, there are also the tools used to make them \u2014 or so you'd think.\n\n\"Globally we have this great historical record of tattooing, but there are relatively few identifications of tattoo implements in the archaeological record \u2014 that has really bothered me,\" he said.\n\n\"It means we are overlooking this an entire category of material culture.\n\n\"Is it because it's not there, is it because people don't know what to look for, or because people deliberately weren't looking for it in the past?\"\n\nMr Deter-Wolf and a colleague have just identified what may be one of the world's oldest collections of tattooing implements \u2014 including sharpened turkey bone tips and mussel shells containing red pigment residue.\n\nThey were originally found at a Native American grave site in Tennessee containing artefacts dated between 1600-3200 BC, and have only been re-analysed now.\n\nThese findings provide the first direct evidence that ancient Native Americans practiced tattooing some 5,000 years ago, Mr Deter-Wolf said.\n\nThe self-experimenting archaeologist\n\nDetermining what tools were used to administer tattoos is a challenge \u2014 one that's turned personal for Mr Deter-Wolf.\n\n\"When you have a long sharp bone tool \u2026 it could be for leather working, making basketry, holding up hair, or it could be tattooing. It could be for anything,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is once archaeologists call it something, it is likely to be that thing you called it forever.\n\n\"It is likely we are biasing the archaeological record with our interpretations.\"\n\nShare Archaeologist Aaron Deter-Wolf becomes the subject for his replica of an ancient bone tattoo tool.\n\nMr Deter-Wolf and others have been conducting so-called microscopic \"usewear\" studies.\n\n\"Usewear is the idea that when you use a tool for something it develops certain microscopic traces,\" he said.\n\n\"For example, if you use a stone tool to cut meat it will have different microscopic trace patterns, [from] when you use the same tool to saw wood or cut cloth.\"\n\nRecent findings confirm the microscopic wear signatures from tattooing skin are identifiable and distinct.\n\nBut such tests are usually done on pig skin as a proxy for human skin.\n\nInstead, Mr Deter-Wolf and his team made replica bone tools using technologies used in prehistoric times \u2014 splitting deer bones and whittling them down using stone tools.\n\nFirst, they tattooed the skin of pig carcasses.\n\nBut they needed to know whether pig hide and human skin would produce a different microscopic wear pattern.\n\n\"There's only one way to test that.

bride-to-be Meghan Markle.\n\nSome British republicans had hoped Mr Turnbull, a well-known high-profile advocate of installing an Australian head of state, would campaign against a Royal being put in the head of Commonwealth role.\n\n\"No-one would have been surprised, no-one would have been upset \u2014 with the possible exception of some of his own backbench,\" Mr Smith said.\n\n\"We can only

the United Kingdom\" should hold the role \u2014 though he said there was no inconsistency in being an Australian republican, while also supporting the British Royal family playing a symbolic Commonwealth leadership role.\n\nAustralian Republican Movement chair Peter FitzSimons said he did not understand why Mr Turnbull backed Prince Charles as the next head of the

overnight, UK Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Queen for her work over the decades and said it was \"fitting\" Prince Charles would succeed his mother due to his backing of the Commonwealth \"for more than four decades\".\n\nCommonwealth leaders also agreed to try to protect the world's oceans from pollution and climate change, and committed themselves to a \"cyber-declaration\" to

The head of the Moscow-based cybersecurity firm is now demanding public answers about an apparent act of censorship.\n\nOn Friday, Eugene Kaspersky, the head of Kaspersky Lab, revealed in a blog post that Twitter has banned the adverts of the Russian company. The decision was taken in January, when Kaspersky Lab received a brief email stating that Twitter has made \u201ca determination that Kaspersky Lab operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices,\u201d according to a screenshot of the message.\n\nKaspersky says he was baffled by the justification because Kaspersky Lab\u2019s business model is essentially the same as that of any other reputable cybersecurity firm: It provides protection from malware for money. \u201cWe didn\u2019t violate any written or unwritten rules,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ban, I believe, violates Twitter\u2019s declared commitment to freedom of expression.\u201d After all, just a few years ago Twitter declared itself \u201cthe free speech wing of the free speech party.\u201d\n\nUS-based Twitter failed to explain its decision in private correspondence, so Kaspersky decided to make the situation public and is demanding equally public answers from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and top management.\n\nRead more\n\nTwitter confirmed the decision on Friday. In a comment to Reuters, the company said that it was partially motivated by a US Department of Homeland Security warning of a threat to national security posed by Russian government access to Kaspersky products. The US government banned the use of Kaspersky products in government computer networks, alleging that they may be used by the Russian government to illegally access computers on which they are installed. Kaspersky Lab denies the allegations and considers the ban an act of unfair competition.\n\nIn an open letter, Kaspersky disclosed statistics on the firm\u2019s use of Twitter advertising tools and what posts were promoted by the company. \u201cJust look at those tweets. They speak about the epidemics of ransomware and give advice on how to protect from it. The materials for teachers giving lessons to kids about digital security. There is a calculator for [the average] cost of cybersecurity across industries. Some are about marketing, but we do sell protection from cyber threats. There is not a trace of violating Twitter advertising rules there.\u201d\n\nHe said Twitter should set the record straight about its controversial decisions, if only to warn other cybersecurity companies how they should act so as not to be banned like Kaspersky Lab was. And that the debate should be public, because Twitter created a dangerous precedent with the ban.\n\n\u201cOther platforms may follow Twitter\u2019s lead. Then any company persecuted for political reasons and falsely accused in the US media may be targeted. This is really wrong. It\u2019s blatant censorship. Business should not be servile to political interest. You are shooting yourselves in the foot when you submit to the politicians and go against the interests of your own business,\u201d Kaspersky warned.\n\nHe added that, regardless of Twitter\u2019s response, Kaspersky will no longer buy ads on the platform and will donate all the money allocated in its 2018 ad budget to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a prominent internet freedom advocacy group.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?

The term, pronounced four-twenty and never four hundred and twenty, according to Snopes.com, was used by members of a group known as 'The Waldos' (as they reportedly used to hang out beside a wall, though the term has also been used to refer to oddballs or outcasts) as a reminder of their daily ritual to meet at 4:20pm to light up a joint or two following one notorious adventure.\n\nThe group of five teenagers, Steve Capper, Dave Reddix, Jeffrey Noel, Larry Schwartz, and Mark Gravich, obtained a hand-drawn map which supposedly pointed to a hidden marijuana-growing operation at Point Reyes, northwest of San Francisco. The man responsible for establishing the plantation was a Coast Guard reservist but no longer had the time nor the desire to maintain the crop and offered it to the group of five friends.\n\nThe group piled into a 1966 Chevy Impala before setting off to find the hidden treasure trove of THC at 4:20pm one afternoon, but they were unsuccessful. \u201cWe were smoking a lot of weed at the time,\u201d says Dave Reddix or Waldo Dave, as cited by Snopes. \u201cHalf the fun was just going looking for it.\u201d Despite multiple such expeditions, known among the group as \u2018safaris,\u2019 the gang never found the rumored Holy Grail of green.\n\nSan Francisco to expunge thousands of marijuana convictions https://t.co/JIqc8gudxFpic.twitter.com/Eus02bHotc \u2014 RT (@RT_com) February 1, 2018\n\nThe group of friends began using the term 420 from then on, spreading the terminology among friends and acquaintances, eventually reaching as far as the rock band The Grateful Dead, and further disseminating worldwide via their fans, affectionately known as Deadheads.\n\nUndercover #420day operations are in place.\n\n\n\nIncognito traps have been set up throughout the city. #Happy420pic.twitter.com/unfsOXiQHk \u2014 Wyoming (MN) Police (@wyomingpd) April 20, 2018\n\nOver the course of the next few decades, however, the term '420' became an internationally recognized identifier that whoever said it identified with the cannabis subculture.

Her crime? Speaking to a Russian-owned radio station.\n\nWhen Changa sat down to talk to WABE\u2019s Johnny Kauffman, she expected to chat about her work as a progressive activist. Instead, Kaufman focused the interview on an appearance Changa had made on Russian-run radio station Sputnik in 2016. The piece was published with the headline \u201cAtlanta Activist Uses Russian-Backed Media To Spread Message.\u201d\n\nChanga, a mother of two, had been an avid supporter of Bernie Sanders in the run-up to the 2016 election. Now Changa is managing editor of a blog called \u2018Progressive Army,\u2019 and hosts a podcast from her native Atlanta, all while holding down a day job and raising two children.\n\nKauffman sat in Changa\u2019s studio \u2013 a friend\u2019s living room equipped with a microphone and webcam\u2013 as she interviewed Amy Vilela, a progressive candidate running for the Democratic nomination in Nevada\u2019s 4th Congressional District. Changa and Vilela spoke of corruption in American politics, but the interview was just a formality before Kaufman turned the heat up on Changa.\n\nIn 2016, Changa spoke on two programs hosted on Sputnik, which broadcasts on AM and FM in Washington DC. While Changa used Sputnik to speak about progressive issues to a wider audience, Kauffman saw sinister Russian plots afoot.\n\nOminously, the article says that \u201cChanga\u2019s association with Sputnik may put her credibility at risk,\u201d and warned that appearing on a Sputnik program furthers \u201cRussia\u2019s effort to create chaos in the US.\u201d\n\nWorking with Sputnik, Kauffman wrote, made things \u201ccomplicated\u201d for Changa.\n\n\u201cInstead of engaging with @TheWayWithAnoa & @EugenePuryear\u2019s years of activism, @wabenews would rather run racist middlebrow schlock, reducing black activists to Russian pawns for the white tote-bag set.\u201d @ProgressiveArmyhttps://t.co/jESgqdaxMe \u2014 Todd Bohannon \ud83c\udf39 (@ToddBohannon) April 20, 2018\n\nFellow activist Eugene Puryear hosts the Sputnik show \u2018By Any Means Necessary,\u2019 on which Changa is a regular. The two talk about police brutality, marginalization, and the influence of money in politics. These issues weren\u2019t important to Kauffman, however. What was important is that Russia pays Puryear\u2019s salary.\n\nSomehow, this means that Sputnik is using leftist causes to further a shady and divisive Russian agenda in America. The fact that Changa also appeared on mainstream outlets like the BBC is not mentioned once, nor is the fact that NPR is funded by the US government. Facts would only get in the way of the narrative.\n\nThat Puryear and his guests often lament the mainstream media\u2019s phony \u2018Russian interference\u2019 narrative only serves as further proof of their guilt in the vast Russian conspiracy.\n\nThe fact that we see all kinds of progressive voices (Anoa Changa, Thom Hartmann, Chris Hedges, Lee Camp) on Sputnik and RT says way more about our mainstream media gatekeepers than it does about those progressives. \u2014 John Gresham (@JohnFGresham) April 18, 2018\n\nTo back up his point and give the Russia hysteria legitimacy, Kauffman cites research professor Robert Ortnung, who claims that Sputnik and RT are sinister news organizations that exist only to further the Bond-villain aims of Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cThose platforms are set up for the sole purpose of promoting the Kremlin line,\u201d Ortnung said. \u201cThe idea is to create as much chaos as possible, because the Russians see it as a zero-sum game, where anything that weakens us is going to strengthen them.\u201d\n\nKauffman neglects to mention that Ortnung is himself a government mouthpiece. He is on the International Forum for Democratic Studies Council at the National Endowment for Democracy, set up by Ronald Reagan at the height of the Cold War to spread the American message abroad. To this day, the NED is almost entirely funded by US government money.\n\nAfter outlining the villains, Kauffman makes his play at the end of the article. He lists a rogues gallery of Georgia politicians that have spoken to RT and Sputnik, before tipping off one politician about the dangers of speaking to a Russian stooge like Changa.\n\nAfter Kauffman told local Democrat Richard Winfield that Changa is a regular guest on a Sputnik show, the politician said that he would not have spoken to her had he known.\n\n\u201cIt raises the possibility of people impugning not just me,\u201d said Winfield, \u201cbut the political positions I\u2019m advancing.\u201d\n\nTwitter exploded after the article was published, as users immediately saw through the obvious smear.\n\nNPR didn't just smear Anoa Changa, they combed through her podcasts and called people she's interviewed digging for Russia dirt.

His family of five lived in a small barrack room which was separated by curtains to make isolated living space for all inhabitants.\n\nAs with many of the strongest Soviet players of his era, Fetisov played for CSKA hockey club, which he joined in 1976, aged 16. Remembering his first years in the Red Army club, Fetisov said that the pride of wearing a CSKA jersey was insurmountable, and he even slept in the club's kit for two months.\n\nHaving played several seasons with the country's best hockey team, Fetisov established himself as one of the most talented defensemen in the Soviet Union, not only destroying the attacks of his rivals, but also possessing fantastic scoring potential.\n\nIn 113 official matches for the USSR, Fetisov netted 42 goals, posting an outstanding record for a defenseman.\n\nIn the 1980s, the newly emerged Larionov-Makarov-Krutov-Kasatanov-Fetisov line shone on the international stage, helping the Soviet squad win back-to-back Olympic golds in 1984 and 1988.\n\nIn 1982, he met his future wife, Lada, who back then was married to a famous Soviet football player, Vagiz Khidiyatullin. Lada's marital status didn't prevent Fetisov from winning the heart of his future wife, and soon they started living together, despite protests from Lada's family.\n\nThe couple couldn't tie the knot for almost seven years, constantly seeing their marriage postponed due to various reasons. First, USSR team head coach Viktor Tikhonov didn't allow Fetisov to leave the training camp, even though the wedding rings had already been bought. Then their nuptials were cancelled after Fetisov's grandmother died. All the preparations for the event were halted again after a tragedy turned Fetisov's life upside down.\n\nOn a summer\u2019s evening in 1985, Fetisov was driving home together with his young brother Anatoly, a promising athlete who was named among the best players at the 1985 European ice hockey championships. A car that attempted to pass Fetisov's \"Zhiguli\" lost control on the wet road and hit the vehicle with the players inside, sending their car directly into a street lamp.\n\nFetisov, who was behind the wheel, managed to survive, but his brother passed away in the crash, aged just 17.\n\nThe player blamed himself for the incident, and said he didn't want to live after the tragedy that shattered the life of his family. But his wife helped him overcome the difficult period and make a return to the ice.\n\nIn 1989, ignoring protests from Soviet hockey bosses, Fetisov and his decorated CSKA linemates traveled to North America to enter the world's best hockey league \u2013 the NHL.\n\nHe made his debut for the New Jersey Devils in 1989, recording eight goals and collecting 42 points during his first NHL season. After six years with the Devils, in April 1995, Fetisov was traded to the Detroit Red Wings. He went on to win two back-to-back Stanley Cups with the team, in 1997 and 1998.\n\nWinning the Stanley Cup also allowed him to join so-called \"Triple Gold Club,\" for players who have won the Stanley Cup, Winter Olympics and World Championship during their careers.\n\nHowever, tragedy struck again right after the 1995 Stanley Cup victory, when yet another car crash marred Fetisov\u2019s life. The player, together with his linemate Vladimir Konstantinov and the team's massage therapist Sergei Mnatsakanov, were heading home in a limousine after the Stanley Cup victory celebration party. The limousine driver, whose license was suspended at the time for drunk driving, lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree.\n\nFetisov was unhurt in the crash, while his Russian friends remained confined to wheelchairs following the tragedy. In the upcoming season, the Red Wings decided to dedicate their second consecutive Stanley Cup victory to their teammates.\n\nKonstantinov, who was brought on the ice in a wheelchair, lifted the prestigious cup together with his former teammates to celebrate their triumph.\n\nHaving won all the major titles in ice hockey, Fetisov announced his retirement in 1998, but he still recreationally plays his favorite sport with the legends of Soviet hockey.\n\nEleven years later after his retirement from professional hockey, Fetisov once again laced up a pair of skates, to play for CSKA Moscow during their KHL game on December 11, 2009, at the age of 51.\n\nFetisov was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Canada, in 2001 and was selected into in the International Centennial All-Star Team by the IIHF as one of the most talented hockey defenseman of the 20th century.\n\nDuring his illustrious sporting career he claimed two Olympic gold medals, two Stanley Cups and seven world titles \u2013 becoming one of the most decorated hockey players of all time."}, {"link": "https://www.rt.com/news/424721-protesters-detained-armenia/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS", "published": "2018-04-20T17:12:01", "title": "Over 230 detained in Armenia as mass opposition protests continue (PHOTOS)", "text": "At least 233 people have been detained by police in the Armenian capital, Yerevan amid mass opposition protests against former President Serzh Sargsyan, who has become the new prime minister.\n\nProtesters and motorists attempting to block the roads with their cars are among those detained, police say. \u201cIf the detained won\u2019t be released in due time, it means they are suspected of committing criminal offences,\u201d the police press service told TASS.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the opposition leader, MP Nikol Pashinyan, urged his supporters to \u201cparalyze traffic in whole Yerevan.\u201d Police warned that they were \u201cready to use force and special equipment to prevent protesters from committing offences.\u201d\n\nMultiple photos and videos show trucks and other vehicles placed across streets at several locations, as well as protesters on foot trying to block traffic.\n\nMostly students and people from IT companies are blocking the streets by creating eternal loop: the same people are crossing the street continuously.

Gold has never been a tool of oppression throughout history,\u201d he added.\n\nOn April 11, the Turkish lira hit a record low against the dollar.\n\nTurkey is among several countries which have been moving gold from the US. The wave began in 2012, when Venezuela announced it was repatriating 160 tons of gold, valued at around $9 billion. Germany\u2019s Bundesbank then demanded 300 tons be returned, with the Fed saying it would take seven years to do so. The Netherlands has also repatriated 122.5 tons of gold.\n\n\u201cThe central banks started the repatriation already a few years ago, meaning before we had Brexit, Catalonia, Trump, AFD or the rising tensions between the Politburo in Brussels and the nations of Eastern Europe,\u201d Claudio Grass of Precious Metal Advisory Switzerland told RT.\n\nAccording to him, the world is becoming less centralized. \u201cIf we follow this trend, it should be obvious that the next step should be an even bigger break up into smaller units than the nation state.

The new changes will allow for American arms supplies to sell weapons to US allies directly, circumventing the State Department, Pentagon, and Congress. Under the new policy, US-made military drones and other equipment are set to gain new global market shares. David Swanson, a journalist and author of the book \u2018War is a Lie\u2019, believes that Trump's decision will lead to more human suffering.\n\nRead more\n\nThe changes will likely increase the profits of American arms manufacturers and defense firms, but critics of the move say it bypasses critical government oversight on where US weapons end up.\n\n\"It is not a dramatic change but it leads to disaster,\" Swanson told RT. \u201cThis is part of a decades trend here.\u201d\n\n\"The United States for a while now has been number one in providing weapons to the world, to the poor countries, dictatorship, often free weapons and aid and training and using the weapons, as well as selling the weapons,\" he added.\n\nBefore changing the export policy, Trump had already approved some deals that former President Barack Obama had blocked, including a $7 billion sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. The deal went ahead despite protests from human rights groups who claim that American weapons are being used to kill civilians in the Saudi-led invasion of Yemen, which has resulted in a massive humanitarian crisis.\n\nWhile administration officials insisted that the new bill will take into consideration human rights records of particular countries, Swanson doubts that US firms will jeopardize their profits over such concerns. Washington, he believes, has no issue with sending arms to countries like Saudi Arabia which carry out \"blatant violations\" against human rights.\n\n\"If the United States cared about human rights it would not be dealing with the weapons in the way that it does,\" Swanson said. He added that US-made weapons have contributed to the \u201cworst humanitarian disasters in recent history.\"\n\nRead more\n\nLoosening restrictions on weapon sales could also lead to scenarios in which American arms fall into the wrong hands, Jennifer Breedon, an attorney specializing in foreign policy and international law, told RT. Pointing to Humvees and other military hardware seized by Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) fighters in Iraq, Breedon noted that \u201cany time a government is involved in a weapons sale or a weapons transfer, there\u2019s always a chance, a risk, that the weapons end up in the hands of rogue elements.\u201d\n\nShe added that the proposed policy changes would bypass much-needed government oversight on where US-manufactured weapons end up. \u201cThere really is a responsibility on the part of the United States, especially on the part of the Department of Defense, to make sure that we know exactly where these weapons are going,\u201d Breedon said.\n\nIn March, the Trump administration approved a $1 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, amid growing international concern about war crimes and a humanitarian crisis brought about by the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. During a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Trump inked a $350 billion arms deal with the kingdom \u2013 the largest in US history.\n\nThe weapon sales make \u201ca mockery\u201d of the 2013 Arms Trade Treaty \u2013 which seeks to establish ethical standards and legal limits for trading weapons and ammunition \u2013 Amnesty International said after Trump announced the latest Saudi arms deal in March.\n\n\u201cThere is extensive evidence that irresponsible arms flows to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition have resulted in enormous harm to Yemeni civilians,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International\u2019s Director of Research for the Middle East. However, she noted that evidence of serious human rights abuses being committed by Saudi forces in Yemen \u201chas not deterred the USA, the UK and other states, including France, Spain and Italy, from continuing transfers of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of such arms.\u201d\n\nLike this story?

So, the short version of what will happen in case of Haftar\u2019s demise is chaos.\n\nAnalysts interviewed by CNBC have suggested that if the LNA gets beheaded, its rivals\u2014and probably parts of it\u2014will rush to the Oil Crescent to secure control over whatever part of the oil producing and exporting infrastructure they can. Production will naturally be disrupted and so will exports, until the dust settles, if ever.\n\nRussian oil producers to make money from China\u2019s yuan-backed crude futures \u2013 analysts https://t.co/kAvQsfR4TY \u2014 RT (@RT_com) April 16, 2018\n\nOne conservative estimate of the effect of this chaos on oil production from Eurasia Group is for a 200,000-bpd decline. This is an amount substantial enough to push prices higher, especially now that global supply is tightening thanks to OPEC\u2019s efforts, but mostly on the back of Venezuela\u2019s strife. Exactly how high prices will jump is difficult to say, but with a sufficient degree of chaos in Libya, Brent could inch a lot closer to the $80US level that Saudi Arabia now eyes as its preferred price.\n\nRead More on Oilprice.com: The one man who could send oil to $100\n\nAnd there\u2019s something else. Even if Haftar is alive and indeed well, chaos may resurface. Yesterday media reported that the LNA\u2019s chief of staff survived an assassination attack with a car bomb. Though it is unclear who was behind the attempt, Libya experts believe the LNA is a blink away from internal fragmentation, which will doubtless spread outside the organization and embolden rival groups to make a power grab for the country\u2019s oil.\n\nThis article was originally published on Oilprice.com"}, {"link": "https://www.rt.com/newsline/424661-korea-hotline-leaders-summit/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS", "published": "2018-04-20T08:43:00", "title": "North & South Korea launch first \u2018leaders hotline\u2019 ahead of summit", "text": "The first ever telephone hotline to connect the leaders of North and South Korea has been launched amid preparations for a rare summit between the nations next week.\n\nSouth Korea confirmed that a successful test call had been made between Seoul\u2019s presidential Blue House and Pyongyang\u2019s powerful State Affairs Commission and added that the telephone conversation between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would take place ahead of their face-to-face meeting.\n\n\u201cThe historic direct telephone line between the leaders of the South and North was connected a short while ago,\u201d South Korean presidential official Youn Kun Young said in a news briefing on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe test call went on for 4 minutes and 19 seconds starting at 3:41pm. with (officials from) both sides speaking to each other ...

The electronic poll ends Thursday night.\n\nPresident Jeff Bell said Friday that Israel\u2019s handling of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High shooting that killed 14 students and three staff members is a major component of the no-confidence campaign, saying he should not have put the full blame on Deputy Scot Peterson, the school\u2019s resource officer.\n\nVideo shows Peterson remained outside after investigators say former student Nikolas Cruz opened fire Feb. 14 inside the three-story freshman building with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Israel said shortly after the shooting that Peterson should have rushed into the building to confront and kill Cruz. Peterson retired rather than accept an unpaid suspension.\n\nBell also has criticized Peterson, but said Israel should not have publicly singled the deputy and should have placed him on paid leave until an investigation into his conduct was completed. He said only deputies accused of crimes are placed on unpaid leave and Peterson has never been charged.\n\nIsrael issued a statement Friday saying it is \u201cunfortunate and appalling\u201d that Bell is using the school shooting \u201cas a bargaining tactic to extort a 6.5 per cent pay raise\u201d for the union\u2019s members. The 3-year-old union represents the office\u2019s deputies who hold the rank of sergeant and below, and its contract expires Sept. 30.\n\nShortly after the shooting, Israel faced backlash for his agency\u2019s possible mishandling of some of the 18 tipster calls it had received about Cruz, 19. The tips were among a series of what authorities now describe as the clearest missed signals that Cruz, who had a history of disturbing behaviour, posed a serious threat. Israel praised himself in a TV interview shortly after the shooting, saying he had shown \u201camazing leadership\u201d in the tragedy\u2019s wake.\n\nBell said contract negotiations played no role in calling the vote and there are other issues besides the shooting. Bell said he discovered the administration had authorized a local auto parts store that supplies the agency\u2019s repair shop to fill its trucks at the office\u2019s pumps, taking thousands of dollars of taxpayer-funded gas. Also, he said Israel says the office cannot afford new guns, equipment and training for deputies but the agency underspent its budget by $100 million last year and is on pace to do it again this year.\n\n\u201cWe just want the equipment and training needed to keep the community safe,\u201d Bell said.\n\nIsrael, a Democrat, was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term in 2016. Republican Gov. Rick Scott rejected calls from some state legislators to suspend him after the shooting.\n\nCruz\u2019s lawyers have conceded he is the shooter and say he will plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence.

The concerns have risen earlier in the week amid The Telegraph reports that more foreign manufacturers than national ones attended the recent Defence Ministry industry day, which is seen as a potential precursor to bidding on one billion pounds ($1.4 billion) worth of the contract to construct the support ships.\n\n\"These ships should be built in the UK, simple as. It would support jobs and be of benefit to the national economy, but what we've also seen over the last few years is more and more of the UK defence budget being spent overseas. By 2020 around 25 pence in every pound of defence spending will be in factories in the US and elsewhere, so we're very much of the view that as much of the UK's defence budget [as possible] should be spent here to support UK jobs, engineering and innovation,\" Flynn said.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS / Jon Gambrell Britain Opens Persian Gulf Naval Base in Bahrain That Will Accomodate Over 300 Troops\n\nFlynn stressed that contracting foreign shipyards to build the auxiliary vessels may launch longer-term trends in UK shipbuilding, with a loss of skills and infrastructure impacting the UK's ability to produce both civilian and military vessels.\n\n\"Right across the UK we've seen a decline in shipbuilding and the capability of the UK to actually build ships. You've seen this over the last few decades, if not more, so there's a danger that with ships such as these support ships not being built here you lose capability,\" Flynn noted, adding that the country risked ultimately finding itself incapable even to construct a new Royal Yacht, if such a need arose.\n\nFlynn noted that the government should thoroughly consider all far-reaching consequences of the upcoming decision, instead of looking for savings in budget. According to Flynn, by building the ships in the United Kingdom, the government will generate new jobs and inflow of taxes, which would, in turn, support struggling public services.\n\n\"The government needs to understand that just because something seems cheaper if you go elsewhere to buy it doesn't mean in the long-term that that's still the case. By building those ships here you are going to put people into work, those people are going to be paying money into the treasury that can go to supporting public services, you'll have other things such as corporation tax as well as jobs in the supply chain as well\u2026 so they need to take a bigger, long-term look at these things,\" he concluded.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Matt Dunham Vast Number of UK-EU Contracts Risk to Be Affected by Brexit - Bank of England\n\nAccording to the GMB trade union's research, around 6,700 jobs would either be created or secured in the event of the construction contract going to a domestic manufacturer.\n\nThe union also believes this would provide a much welcome cash injection into the UK's struggling welfare system, with an estimated 285,000 million pounds ($400,000) finding its way into the Treasury through national insurance contributions, income tax and reduced welfare claims."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201804211063772738-expert-explains-cuban-president/", "published": "2018-04-21T03:37:58", "title": "Expert Explains What Challenges New Cuban President to Face", "text": "Miguel Diaz-Canel has been sworn in as the President of Cuba, assuming power from Raul Castro, this marked the first time in six decades when the nation\u2019s head is not a Castro family member. Radio Sputnik discussed this event with Dr. Helen Yaffe, Lecturer in Economic and Social History, University of Glasgow and analyst on Cuba and Latin America.\n\nSputnik: For the first time since the revolution in Cuba the leader of the nation is not a Castro. How significant is this particular fact?\n\nDr. Helen Yaffe: I think there\u2019re two ways to approach this question. The first is symbolically. The fact that the Cuban revolution has now proven some resilience and sustainability by outliving the Castros in a sense is very important. Miguel Diaz-Canel, who was just elected as the new President of the Council of State, demonstrates this fact, because he was born after the revolution. He is 57 and the revolution is 59, it\u2019ll be 60 on the 1st of January next year. I think this is an intelligent, strategic decision to take someone who was born and educated entirely by the system. On the other hand, there\u2019s clearly going to be continuity in the Revolutionary Government and in the process of socialist construction. And again Diaz-Canel made that absolutely clear with his speech in the National Assembly.\n\nSputnik: What do we know exactly about Miguel Diaz-Canel? As you\u2019ve said, he\u2019s a product of the system, but anything particularly interesting and striking there?\n\nDr. Helen Yaffe: Some information is starting to come out. He\u2019s had very low profile in the last few years, really since he\u2019s been in the position of First Vice-President of the Council of State, which he'd held for several years. There are stories emerging of the character of his leadership of the Cuban Communist Party in Las Vilas province. He was seen as very in touch, very connected with the local people, he was very concerned to learn about the real problems in the area and get them addressed. He was very a demanding but very personable person \u2013 knows people by name and so on. I think that is one aspect of him that outside of Cuba we haven\u2019t really seen yet. He hasn\u2019t really had a high profile in recent years; that may have been a strategic decision, but one has to see how his style flourishes now that he\u2019s in this new position.\n\nSputnik: Perhaps you could narrow down just a few of the most important challenges that the newly elected leader is going too face now?\n\nDr. Helen Yaffe: There are going to be economic challenges, but in a socialist society, of course, the economy can\u2019t be separated from politics and the social question. So the question of increasing productivity and efficiency in state enterprises, unification of the dual currency system \u2013 this is becoming an increasingly urgent need, it\u2019s becoming an obstacle to productivity and also to foreign investments, and also handling the Trump administration in the US.\n\nSputnik: How different would the relations between Cuba and the US develop moving forward? Do you think that this end of the Castro era could also signify the end of the embargo era perhaps as well?\n\nDr. Helen Yaffe: I think that could have been on the cards under Obama or a similar regime in the US. The fact that Trump has been flip-flopping on the Cuba question, first being in favor of rapprochement and even sending his own business representatives to Cuba before rapprochement happened, well before he was even a candidate in the elections. Trump has taking a very hostile line; he's strengthened elements of the US embargo which were loosened by Obama. It\u2019s not entirely a reversal, but he\u2019s also up to the sort of hostility of the rhetoric and he\u2019s really allowing his Cuba policy to be dictated by a very small number of a Cuban-American politicians who are utterly hostile to the Cuban system.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/asia/201804211063772561-korea-japan-lauds-criticizes-dprk-tests-end/", "published": "2018-04-21T03:03:44", "title": "Japan\u2019s Abe Lauds North Korea Move to End Nuclear Tests", "text": "TOKYO (Sputnik) - Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday praised the move by North Korea to halt nuclear and long-range missile testing.\n\n\"This is a step forward.

Last year, a video of a Communist Party meeting was leaked in which Mr Diaz-Canel voiced several orthodox positions that included a promise to close some independent media.\n\nSputnik: What impact will the new president have on Cuba going forward or will Castro still hold political influence?\n\nStephanie Panichelli-Batalla: yes my answer is going in the way of Raul Castro maintaining a lot of political influence. Critics and Journalists have said its true we have someone new, someone associated with the Cuban revolution in the 50\u2019s, someone not called Castro, someone from a younger generation and that\u2019s very important. But on the other hand we have Raul Castro who remains the leader of the Communist party which is quite a big one. In addition to that he only selected one candidate, who he has been training for quite a few years now. So it\u2019s not someone new with new ideas that might lead to unexpected changes but someone who has been carefully selected and carefully trained who will continue to work in collaboration with Raul Castro. So in my point of view, yes we have a new president but it will very much remain the same, Castro will still have big political influence for any decision being taken in Cuba.\n\nSputnik: He mentions continuity, so are we likely to see an easing of tensions between Havana & Washington?\n\nStephanie Panichelli-Batalla: I don\u2019t think we are about to see that happening, of course the change in President in the US, made the relationship between America and Cuba a lot worse than it had been when Obama was in power.

His departure brings into question other allegations of sexual exploitation that have rippled through Politics, Hollywood and the charity sector this year.\n\nSputnik spoke with Lindsay Blumell, a journalist who focuses intensively on women\u2019s rights, about the issues.\n\nSputnik: Will the charities affected such as Save the Children and Oxfam be able to regain public trust since the allegations have been made public?\n\nLindsay Blumell: I think the question that should be asked is: How do we stop systemic violence against women- not how do we preserve the reputation of organizations. Obviously, charities are not alone in this. We know, statistically speaking, and throughout most countries in the world, there are severe problems of harassment, abuse and assault against women- privately and also in the workplace. So I would say that charities for sure are not immune. I think that in most cases there is a huge power difference between those at the top (which are mostly men) and those that are working, which is a combination between men and women. So we see it in Hollywood, in charity and in politics, men that have this huge amount of power are then able to act in this way without being called out.\n\nSputnik: Do you think we will see a change in public perspective over sexual misconduct? Maybe more victims coming forward as a result of increased transparency?\n\nLindsay Blumell: Unfortunately also, from the public perspective, there is a tendency to doubt, to overlook, and to not think that this is serious. So I think whether this will have a long term consequence or not will depend on the public in whether they take these things seriously. So far, there have been a lot of cases over the years where the public, people in organizations and so forth have just turned a blind eye to it. That\u2019s why so few survivors of harassment will actually file a complaint or go to the police, because it is so rare that anything will ever come of it. Hopefully, this will be a changing tide. That the public will not turn a blind eye, that they'll actually want to hold these organizations responsible.\n\nIn the justice system, the laws were made for men, by men. Therefore very few things get properly prosecuted. It\u2019s the same case in police departments, (which I feel like now are starting to change) but there is a lot of doubting, blaming the victim, asking her 'what were you wearing', 'were you drinking', all of these things that shouldn't play a part in whether that person is guilty or not, but that is more focused on than the actual act itself.\n\nSputnik: Where is the main issue here? Sir Alan Parker only resigned once the abuse was made public, but the charity allegedly knew of the misconduct for some time.\n\nLindsay Blumell: The actual reputation of these organizations that have been damaged, because of the abuse put forward by a few- probably not collective abuse, but abuse from those with power. Therefore that permeates throughout the organization, because certainly they were not unknown, others in the organization would have had to have known these things, especially since they were going on for years. So they turned a blind eye, maybe they protected it, maybe they felt scared because they didn't have the same power, who knows, there is many different ways that this has happened. So it depends. Are they going to hold these people responsible? Are they going to change? Are they going to have more men and women sharing the power at the top? Are they going to have more transparency? If they do that then they can survive these abuse cases.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201804211063772027-democrats-russiagate-suit-votes-2018/", "published": "2018-04-21T00:46:00", "title": "Democrats\u2019 Russiagate Lawsuit a \u2018Desperate Move\u2019 to Earn Votes in 2018 Elections", "text": "The DNC filed a civil lawsuit seeking millions of dollars from WikiLeaks, the Trump campaign, and the Russian government for engaging in conspiracy.

The 2018 summit explored the simulation of the energy mix in a future digital world. Sputnik discussed this with Francesco Profumo, the former minister of education and technology innovation.\n\nThe Global Energy Prize was established in Russia in 2002 by the Global Energy Association with the support of companies such as Gazprom, FGC UES and Surgutneftegaz. The prize is awarded for research and technological projects that contribute to the growth of energy efficiency, the development of green energy sources and the improvement of the quality of life. The honorees are awarded the Global Energy Prize at the International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg along with a prize of 39 million rubles.\n\nSputnik: The Global Energy Prize Summit shows the importance of international cooperation in the energy sector; how do you assess the relations between Italy and Russia in this area?\n\nFrancesco Profumo: The energy sector and the steel industry account for the majority of Russian investments in Italy. In 2015, energy imports from Russia amounted to 20.4 percent of international imports and 17.2 percent of European imports and exceeded energy imports from Saudi Arabia by 5.55 times. Especially important is the import of gas, in 2015, Italy imported from Russia 45.1 percent of all consumed gas. As for oil, here Russia plays a key role with 15.9 percent of the total supply.\n\nSputnik: What role will Russian gas play in the European energy market in the coming years? Will it be able to maintain its position in the medium and long term?\n\nFrancesco Profumo: Probably, in the future Russian gas will retain its key role in the European market. We can name some current projects that can strengthen Russia's role in the natural gas market. The underwater gas pipeline Nord Stream since 2012 connects Russia and Germany through the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream 2, the construction of which should be completed in 2019, has caused fierce international disputes, as it will further strengthen Europe's energy dependence on Russia. The TurkStream gas pipeline that replaced the South Stream project, will connect Russia with Turkey and Europe bypassing Ukraine. Its length will be 1,090 kilometers, capacity \u2013 31.5 billion cubic meters per year. The TurkStream and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), that's under construction, will allow Italy to again become a gas hub for the south of Europe. Another project, the Yamal LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant, is already partially operating. The third and last production line should be launched in 2019. The terminal's capacity is 16.5 million tons per year (5.5 million tons per line). Liquefied gas from this terminal will be exported not only to Asian countries (Japan, South Korea, India), but also to Europe. This terminal was built within the framework of the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative (the China National Petroleum Corporation and the Silk Road Fund have a share of 20.0 percent and 9.9 percent respectively in it), and its goal is not only to play a significant strategic role in the export of Russian gas to Asian countries (Japan, South Korea, India), but also subsequently influence the European LNG market."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/military/201804211063771559-japan-lockheed-martin-hybrid-f-22/", "published": "2018-04-20T23:47:50", "title": "Japan Asks Lockheed Martin to Craft Hybrid F-35 and F-22 Aircraft", "text": "Tokyo and Lockheed Martin are reportedly discussing the creation of a hybrid F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft to protect Japanese airspace starting in 2030.\n\n\u007fThe Japanese government is seeking to buy a design for an aircraft that melds together the F-22 Raptor, which is prohibited from being exported and no longer in production, and the F-35 Lightning, which Tokyo is already buying from America's largest defense contractor.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque Washington by No Means Interested in China-Japan Thaw \u2013 Analysts\n\nThe design would incorporate \"the F-22 and F-35 and could be superior to both of them,\" a source told Reuters on Friday.

Why is the Truman heading over there right now at flank speed?

Barbara Ehrenreich then called it \u2018The Bimbo Bombings,\u2019\" he said.\n\nBoyle predicted Trump was likely to resort again to bombing Syria in his efforts to distract the US public from Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into his affairs.\n\n\"I am afraid we will probably be seeing more bombing by Mr. Trump as the whole Mueller-gate matter is not going away\u2026 It is important to understand the danger here Trump is in the same situation as Clinton. The danger is not past. Syria could become the Sarajevo of 1914,\" Boyle said.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s political opponents and war hawks wanted to push the president into more strikes against the Dasacus government, Boyle warned.\n\n\"It does seem to me that they are using the Mueller investigation to pressure Trump to attack Syria,\" he said.\n\nUS RUNNING RISKS OF 1914 SARAJEVO-STYLE ESCALATION\n\nHistorian and political commentator Dan Lazare agreed that the April 13 strike had only been intended as the first step of a far more massive US military campaign against Syria.\n\n\"The US cannot leave Syria, it will never leave Syria, and the Friday the 13th missile strike is only a foretaste of greater US military aggression to come\u2026 Damascus is the Sarajevo of the 21st century,\" he said.\n\nThe April 13 missile strikes themselves appear to have been a compromise between the president and his defense secretary, Lazare observed.\n\n\"Trump wanted a show of force \u2014 while Defense Secretary Mattis didn't want anything that might spiral out of control. So, the US warned Russia that Trump was about to blast some empty buildings to pieces,\" he said.\n\nLazzare warned the attack shows that the United States cannot resign itself to the fact that President Bashar Assad is winning the Syrian Civil War and that it will therefore ratchet up its intervention as he tries to consolidate his gains.\n\n\"US policy has never been more cynical, vicious, and foolhardy. But as bad as Trump is, the rest of official Washington is even worse,\" he said.\n\nSince the missiles were launched, all one hears is that they weren't enough, Congress is crazy, and the press is even worse, Lazzare added."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/us/201804211063771092-FOIA-Request-Docs-Psycho-Electronic-Weapons/", "published": "2018-04-20T22:53:00", "title": "\u2018Mind Control\u2019 Leak?

Would the mid-way refueling be viewed as a sign of weakness in Air Koryo\u2019s planes and hurt North Korea\u2019s dignity? North Korean leaders have never traveled overseas on foreign aircraft while still in office. Without any precedents, we don't know the possibility of them accepting this option,\" he said.\n\nSoutheast Asian nations may not be a better choice for North Korea, compared to locations in Europe, the expert added.\n\n\"Southeast Asian countries like Singapore could be accepted by the United States. But for North Korea, traveling to Singapore is almost the same as traveling to Europe, because the travel distance is also out of the range of Air Koryo\u2019s planes and would require refueling on the way. The cost and security complexity of traveling to Southeast Asia is almost the same as traveling to Europe for North Korea,\" he said.\n\nZhao explained why Trump might not want to travel to the Korean Peninsula for the summit.\n\n\"For Trump, Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone is too deserted to hold this grand summit. It\u2019s not enough to support the historic scene Trump wants. And after the inter-Korea summit takes place there, Trump definitely doesn\u2019t want to follow the footsteps of others and would prefer a new location,\" he said.\n\nEurope-based North Korea watchers suggested that Jeju Island off the coast of the Korean Peninsula could be a viable option.\n\n\"Another possibility [for the summit] I have not seen mentioned in the media is Jeju Island in South Korea. The summit between [former South Korean president] Kim Dae-jung and [former North Korean leader] Kim Jong-il was held in Pyongyang. It could be time for Kim Jong Un go to South Korea, not to Seoul, but perhaps to Jeju Island, which has excellent facilities for the summit. I think Kim Jong Un would be more comfortable having a meeting somewhere in Asia,\" Stein Tonnesson, a research professor focusing on East Asian peace research at the Peace Research Institute in Oslo, told Sputnik.\n\nNegotiation Tricks\n\nTrump expressed optimism about his upcoming summit with the North Korean leader and stressed his firm stance by vowing to \"pull out\" if he finds meeting not productive.\n\n\"If I think that if it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting when I'm there is not fruitful I will respectfully leave the meeting,\" Trump said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nDespite his usual hawkish rhetoric, Trump may become more pragmatic when meeting with Kim Jong Un, Zhao from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center argued.\n\nREAD MORE: US Strikes on Syria Message to Iran, N Korea \u2014 Constitutional Commision Member\n\n\"I believe Trump\u2019s comments fit his usual style for negotiations. Before the negotiations start, he would raise the bar really high with all kinds of excessive demands. It was the same situation when South Korea and the United States negotiated on trade issues. Trump made a lot of demands, but once South Korea offered some concessions, Trump was easily satisfied. As long as they can meet, I don\u2019t think Trump will admit that this important decision of meeting Kim Jong Un was a mistake. No matter what kind of results come out in the end, Trump would describe the meeting as a key historic success,\" he said.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2018 / JUNG YEON-JE 'Active Shooter' False Alarm at US Base in S Korea Puts Soldiers on Lockdown\n\nZhao explained it is difficult for Trump to convince Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons completely in the near future.\n\n\"It\u2019s unlikely for Kim Jong Un to make fundamental concessions on his nuclear arsenal. It\u2019s possible for him to set denuclearization as a long-term goal. But it\u2019s hard for me to imagine North Korea to agree to a specific timetable of 3-5 years to eliminate its nuclear weapons completely. I believe Trump will not hold onto the difficult demand of complete denuclearization for North Korea in the short term. He could accept a promise from North Korea to denuclearize in the future and start the process of reaching this goal,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Tonnesson from Peace Research Institute in Oslo pointed out that the details of the agreement between Trump and Kim Jong Un, as well as how it is going to be executed, will be the true testament whether the summit is a success.\n\n\"There will be a clear promise from the North Korean side to contribute to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But the details are what really count here. I doubt North Korea would sign on to international inspection or reduction in their number of nuclear bombs. These are the kind of details that hopefully someone in the Trump administration would put on the negotiation table and get North Korea to agree to a concrete deadline. I do not trust the Trump administration\u2019s ability to develop this kind of waterproof agreement sufficiently. My fear is that Kim Jong Un and Trump will make a vague deal and they can tell the world that we have this great peace agreement. And next year, we see a conflict coming up about the implementation,\" he said.\n\nA Normal Country\n\nAfter announcing North Korea completed the development of its nuclear arms program last November, following the successful test of its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile, Kim Jong Un adapted a foreign policy that focuses on dialogue with the outside world, by sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics held in South Korea and agreeing to meet with both South Korean and US leaders.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian Admiral Explains Why Western Strike on Syria Was Poorly Coordinated\n\nKim Jong Un has always been following the same strategy consistently and aspired to become a reform-minded leader like Deng Xiaoping, who is often viewed as the architect the reform and opening-up policy that kick-started China\u2019s explosive economic growth in the past 40 years, Zhao from the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center suggested.\n\n\"I believe North Korea had a two-step strategy. The first step was to develop basic nuclear deterrence capabilities at all cost to meet its fundamental security needs. This target was reached by the end of 2017. Now they\u2019re entering the second step of developing normalized relations with the international community, while maintaining its existing nuclear capabilities. The most appealing signal Kim Jong Un sent out is that he wants to focus on economic development, after addressing the nation\u2019s security concerns. His long-term goal is to become North Korea\u2019s Deng Xiaoping. He hopes to turn North Korea into a prosperous and well respected normal country in the international community,\" he said.\n\nThe expert believes such intentions from Kim Jong Un are widely welcome by many countries, including the United States, because North Korea will be less obsessed with developing nuclear weapons and become a less security threat in the region, once it becomes an accepted member of the international community.\n\nViews and opinions expressed in this article are those of the contributors and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/201804201063766327-counter-protest-germany-neo-nazis-hitler-birthday/", "published": "2018-04-20T19:17:35", "title": "Counter Protest Planned as German Neo-Nazis Amass for Festival on Hitler\u2019s B-Day", "text": "While more and more people flock to Polish and Czech borders with Germany on Friday, a police chief has reported on police regiments being deployed almost everywhere in the area.\n\nHordes of neo-Nazis are gathering for a music festival in the German town of Ostritz, which essentially coincides with the Fuhrer\u2019s birthday, the German media reported.\n\nThe police in Germany and neighboring Poland are reportedly checking people arriving in the town for the so-called \"Shield and Sword festival,\" which is expected to draw up to 1,000 far-right extremists from Germany, the neighboring Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nAlthough authorities have failed to stop the concert from happening because it is taking place on private property, a court on Friday confirmed a ban on the consumption of alcohol during the major two-day event.

The scared boy declined to speak to the camera. Correspondents only managed to take a picture of him from a distance. After a while, the kid got settled and started speaking out.\n\n\"[We] Kids were gathered near the hospital and told that we would get cookies and bags of potatoes, if we did everything right.

There, we were being filmed.

Sputnik France contributor Irina Dmitrieva decided to look back at a few other incidents which led to wars in the decades, centuries and millennia past.\n\nThe suspected Douma attack prompted the US and its allies to fire over 100 missiles into Syria, just hours before the arrival of a fact-finding mission by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Days earlier, Russian chemical warfare specialists visited the site of the alleged attack, finding no traces of chemical weapons use. Furthermore, the video evidence purporting to show the fallout from a chemical attack at a Douma hospital has come under intense scrutiny amid eyewitness testimony suggesting that no chemical attack had taken place.\n\nSputnik contributor Irina Dmitrieva outlined eight other egregious cases of false flag attacks used to serve some political or military goal.\n\nReichstag Fire\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the night of February 27, 1933, Reichstag Palace, the seat of the German parliament in Berlin, was ravaged by fire. Police arrived on the scene and arrested Marinus van der Lubbe, an unemployed Dutch communist. Germany's fledgling Nazi authorities used the fire for political purposes, presenting it as a criminal act by Germany's then-powerful communist opposition. The fire put an end to personal freedom in the Weimar Republic, and marked the beginning of the campaign to crush all opposition to the Nazis.\n\n\"There are several versions about what happened that night, from an act of an individual to a Nazi conspiracy,\" Dmitrieva wrote. \"Subsequent investigations found that the building was already burning in several areas by the time the Dutch communist arrived. French historian Jacques Delarue believes that the act of arson was committed by a Nazi stormtrooper on the initiative of Hermann Goering.\"\n\nVial of Anthrax in the Lead-up to Iraq War\n\nOn February 5, 2003, US Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a speech at the UN, waving a prop vial of anthrax, meant to represent Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's supposed efforts to hide his weapons of mass destruction. The UN Security Council refused to support US-led intervention. However, a month and a half later, the US and the UK started a military operation anyway.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Elise Amendola The image seen round the world of Secretary of State Colin Powell and his mock vial of anthrax,which he held up during a presentation before the UN on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction program, February 5, 2003.\n\nThe Iraq War cost the coalition thousands of military casualties, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians were killed. The war also led to the near collapse of the state of Iraq, and the rise of Daesh (ISIS).* No substantial evidence of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons were never found.\n\nA year after the war began, Powell admitted that he had been misinformed, and that the details in his UN presentation were \"wrong.\"\n\nMukden Incident\n\nThe Mukden Incident, also known as the Manchurian Incident, took place on the night of September 18, 1931, and marked the beginning of the Second World War in Asia. The incident saw soldiers of Japan's Kwantung Army laying a bomb near the railway track at the Japan-leased South Manchuria Railway near the city of Mukden, on the border with Japanese-controlled Korea. Tokyo blamed the incident on China, thus justifying its invasion of Manchuria. The invasion succeeded, and Japan's occupation lasted until August 1945. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East established in Tokyo after the war under the Potsdam agreements concluded that several senior Japanese officers were responsible for the plot.\n\nCC0 / Japanese cavalry entering Mukden (Shenyang) Japanese troops enter Manchuria following the Mukden incident.\n\nGulf of Tonkin Incident\n\nThe incidents in the Gulf of Tonkin on August 2nd and 4th, 1965 triggered the American war in Vietnam. According to the version long adhered to by the United States, North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked the US Navy destroyer USS Maddox on August 2nd in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, prompting a skirmish.\n\nFollowing the incident, President Lyndon Johnson ordered the destroyer USS Turner Joy to support the Maddox, and on the night of August 4, they made their way back to the Gulf of Tonkin, where they were again 'attacked' by unidentified enemies and returned fire. US aviation deployed to the area did not manage to find the 'enemy ships', but Washington was informed.\n\nThe incident prompted Congress to authorize President Johnson to start a military operation in Vietnam on August 7, 1964. By 1965, the US had sent over 200,000 troops to the country, with the number going up to over 500,000 by 1968. The Vietnam War lasted a decade, and led to the deaths of over 58,000 US servicemen, and up to 3.1 million Vietnamese, as well as 300,000 Cambodians and 62,000 Laotians.\n\nIn 2003, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara admitted that the attack on the Maddox on August 4 and used to justify the war never took place. Two years later, documents declassified by the NSA confirmed that doubts about the Tonkin attack were raised from the very beginning of the investigation.\n\nUSS Maine Explosion\n\nOn February 15, 1898, an explosion took place on the battleship USS Maine in Havana harbor, killing 260 men, or two thirds of the ship's crew. Washington immediately blamed Spain, which controlled Cuba at the time, for the attack, with US media presenting Spain's guilt as an established fact despite a lack of evidence.\n\nOn April 19, Congress passed a resolution demanding that Spain leave Cuba. Days later, US forces opened fire on Spanish emplacements in Havana. By mid-August 1898, Madrid lost the war. Under the peace treaty, Spain was forced to transfer its colonies in Asia and Latin America, including the Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico and Cuba, to the United States.\n\nA 1976 investigation by US Admiral Hyman G. Rickover conducted an investigation, concluding that the sinking of the Maine may have been caused a spontaneous combustion in the ship's coal bins, an issue which afflicted other ships at the time.\n\nMainila Incident\n\nThe shelling of Mainila, the incident which led to the Soviet-Finnish Winter War, took place on November 26, 1939. The same day, the Soviet government sent a note of protest to the Finnish government, accusing Finnish forces of firing seven artillery shells into Soviet forces, which led four dead and nine injured. Moscow demanded that Finland withdraw its troops 20-25 km from the border. Helsinki demanded that Moscow do the same.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik / Red Army troops in Karelia during Winter War.\n\nMoscow refused, since this would mean withdrawing into Leningrad. Red Army commanders were ordered to initiate return fire to any attacks along the border. Four days later, Soviet forces began an invasion of Finland. For decades afterward, Soviet historians argued that Finland was to blame for the incident. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, new theories arose in Russia, including that the incident was staged by the NKVD, precursor to the KGB, or that the November 26 incident did not lead to any Soviet losses in the first place. In 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the Winter War as a war of aggression.\n\nGleiwitz Incident\n\nThe Gleiwitz incident was organized by the Nazis in Gleiwitz, eastern Germany (now Poland) on August 31, 1939.\n\nOn the night of August 31, German soldiers dressed in Polish military uniforms seized a radio transmitter at Gleiwitz, calling on the Polish minority in Silesia to rise up and overthrow Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe false flag attack, dubbed Operation Himmler, was intended to legitimize the Nazi German invasion of Poland. Details of the false flag attack were revealed by the confession of SS functionary Alfred Naujocks at the Nuremberg Trials in 1945.\n\nOn September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On September 3 and 4, France and Britain joined the war, prompting the start of the Second World War in Europe.\n\nGreat Fire of Rome\n\nFalse flags are by no means just a product of the last two centuries. On July 18, 64 BC, Rome, one of the largest cities of Antiquity, was struck by a fire which raged six days and seven nights, completely destroying three of the city's fourteen districts and damaging seven others, and leading to thousands of deaths.\n\nEmperor Nero took immediate steps to restore the city, but this did not silence rumors that he was responsible for the blaze. This prompted the emperor to blame Christians. Roman historian Tacitus emphasized that the persecution of Christians began immediately after the fire.\n\n\"Any resemblance between these historical provocations and current events is accidental,\" Dmitrieva wrote. However, \"just as the Great Fire of Rome led to atrocities against civilian populations, any provocation today can lead to violence and even war. Let's hope that no country in the world will compel humanity to pay this price in the name of its national interests,\" the journalist concluded.\n\n*A terrorist group banned in Russia."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201804201063765618-syria-russia-s-300-supplies/", "published": "2018-04-20T19:01:04", "title": "Russian S-300 Supplies to Syria to Boost Political Stability - Syrian Lawmaker", "text": "YALTA (Sputnik) - Russia's deliveries of the S-300 air defense missile systems to Syria will contribute to the political stability of the Syrian government, Samer Shiha, a member of the Syrian People\u2019s Assembly, told Sputnik on Friday.\n\n\"Of course, S-300 deliveries will contribute to the government's political stability,\" Shiha said on the sidelines of the IV Yalta International Economic Forum in Crimea, answering a corresponding question.\n\nEarlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Sputnik that Moscow was no longer bound by a moral duty not to supply Damascus with S-300 air defense missile systems after last week's Western strikes on Syria.\n\nREAD MORE: Lavrov on S-300 Supply: After West's Attack, We Mull All Options to Defend Syria\n\nShiha went on saying that Russia can help Syria's economic recovery through its heavy industry.\n\n\"There are many opportunities in Russia to help Syria restore everything that has been destroyed and Russia has extensive experience in these areas, economic, or tourism, or reconstruction of houses.

Alliances in Mid East Are Like Shifting Sand - Professor", "text": "Sputnik: What're your thoughts on the probability of Egypt, Qatar and, or the United Arab Emirates agreeing to contribute troops and/or financial assistance to Syria?\n\nAlpaslan Ozerdem: I think there are two possible scenarios, positions here.\n\nThe first one is the Arab states would provide financial assistance for a certain Arab force to be deployed in Syria.\n\nAnd the second one is that the Arab states would both finance and contribute troops.\n\nI think for me both are problematic with some possible negative consequences on the conflict in Syria and possibly not quite possible. Let's start with the first one. In terms of feasibility, the Arab states, particularly the rich Persian Gulf countries, funding such an army might be possible. Probably they would source troops from other countries, say Sudan, or perhaps from Pakistan. However, they also talk about the involvement of the military contractor, Blackwater USA. That may play a role in this and it might be even run the Arab force in Syria. For me that is really dangerous. And when we look at the possibility of deploying Arab forces on the ground the picture is I'm afraid is not any better. First of all, to start with there're major political problems within some of those countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt on the one hand and Qatar on the other. So how can they possibly come up with an agreement on such a force is really questionable. And second, if they are deployed then there's Gulf Arab troops engaging in confrontation with Iranian forces in Syria, for example, could easily reverse the situation. And finally it's also important to see how the other regional actors would react to such an Arab force, for example Turkey.\n\nREAD MORE: War in Syria 'Is Not Over by a Long Shot,' Analyst Explains Why\n\nSo the alliances in the Middle East are like shifting sand. So overall this whole idea of finding Middle Eastern solutions for Middle Eastern problems could be a futile exercise.\n\nSputnik: As you mentioned there're conflicts of interests and even stances between all of the countries involved. Can you comment on which countries in particular might be most likely to contribute troops on the ground?\n\nAlpaslan Ozerdem: Amongst the Arab countries, now, for example Saudi Arabia seems to be engaging in the conversation with the Trump administration on this. But whether or not Saudi Arabia would deploy forces while they're waging a war in Yemen I think is really questionable, because with Yemen, there's a direct security threat, so it's a priority for them. Diverting their troops and deploying in Syria I don't think that will be happening. So the most likely countries would be perhaps Sudan or Pakistan or other countries that would have that kind of military power but not funding and may be convinced to be part of this alliance.\n\nREAD MORE: Expert Explains Why Plan to Replace US Military in Syria With Arab Troops Flawed\n\nSputnik: I'm just wondering if there's really a political will as far as Pakistan getting involved in a war and how even if it's being funded by somebody else you also mentioned Blackwater. Wouldn't the US be interested in doing this in order to sort of keep out of the conflict in Syria? Trump has been promising to get out of Syria, Blackwater would still I think be perceived as a US presence.\n\nAlpaslan Ozerdem: Yes, it would and on in your first part of the question, in terms of countries like Pakistan or Sudan yes, there are a lot of question marks. For example when Saudi Arabia started its military engagement in Yemen, I think they were hoping that both Egypt and also Pakistan would work with them, would assist them, but that never happened. So the whole question of where the troops would come would be a significant one. And in terms of the US presence what we see is that Donald Trump keeps changing his mind on Syria, almost on a daily basis. The withdrawal of 2,000 US forces that has already created quite a big division between the US administration the military personnel on the ground don't agree with Trump. I think what we are seeing is a very complicated and divisive picture here.\n\nThe idea of deploying an Arab force in Syria with some serious consequences for the security or the worsening of the situation, is hugely problematic.\n\nSputnik: we also have players like Israel, Turkey and Iran of course all in a mix on the ground right now not on the ground but actively involved in Syria in any case. What can you say about the possibility of some kind of Arab forces and how would that impact the situation among the countries that are involved in this Syrian conflict already?\n\nAlpaslan Ozerdem: I think that will be a huge discontent for the Kurds if the US decides on a complete withdrawal. For Israel, though, it's really interesting that over the last few months Israel has been building closer relations with the gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. That could actually, that's a very interesting question and probably this would get a backup from Israel politically. I think that would be indeed interesting.\n\nThe views of the speaker do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/201804201063764617-germany-data-leak-probe-facebook/", "published": "2018-04-20T18:33:23", "title": "German Data Protection Watchdog Initiates Data Leak Probe Against Facebook", "text": "MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Hamburg Data Protection Authority, which is responsible for overseeing Facebook activities across Germany, has initiated an administrative case against the company in connection with Cambridge Analytica personal data leak scandal, the authority's head, Johannes Caspar, said Friday.\n\n\"We are currently examining a possibility to initiate proceedings against Facebook,\" Caspar said, as quoted by the Handelsblatt newspaper.\n\nThe US company is suspected of misusing the data of its users, he said, adding that the first step would be a hearing on the accusations.\n\nREAD MORE: Manipulating User Info to Political Ends on Facebook, Google a 'Serious Problem'\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2018 / Daniel LEAL-OLIVAS Regulator Files Inquiry With Cambridge Analytica to Check for Russian Facebook Users\u2019 Data\n\nIn March, US media reported that the personal information of about 50 million Facebook users had been harvested without their permission by Cambridge Analytica consultancy, which worked for multiple political campaigns using the data to develop a mechanism that would predict and influence the behavior of voters.\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and Canada have already decided to probe Facebook.

His comments sent the pound sterling's FX rate lower, as investors were pricing in the long-anticipated policy-tightening move.\n\nCarney's remarks came about as quite unexpected, as the UK's inflation is far above the BOE's 2-percent target, while the overall economic growth has been solid despite investor concerns over the tumultuous Brexit talks. UK employment is near its multi-year highest, while gains in salaries and wages are only percentage points behind the broader inflation measure.\n\n\"The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path,\" Carney said in a BBC interview, adding that a few interest rate hikes are planned over the next several years.\n\nCarney said MPC actions this year will be data-dependent, adding the Committee will make its decision on base borrowing costs in May \u2018conscious that there are other meetings' to implement the move later this year.

Despite this most macro fundamentals remain solid.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has warned that the UK might become the slowest-growing among the advanced economies this year, unless it's able to strike a mutually-beneficial Brexit deal with the EU.\n\nCarney stressed that the MPC will be assessing the state of the economy \u2018in the round' when making its decision on rates.\n\nThe BOE Governor also acknowledged the risks and uncertainty stemming from the Brexit process as influencing central bank policymaking process. Carney said future developments in the Brexit talks and a resulting separation deal will require monetary policy adjustments aimed at \"keep(ing) the economy at a stable path.\"\n\nThe BOE's policy meeting is slated for 10 May, and the expectations of a rate high were adding to the upward pressure on the pound \u2014 which hit $1.44 earlier this week, before sliding to $1.41 following Carney's remarks.\n\nHowever, some observers point out that the BOE might still go ahead with the May hike, and if not, more than one rate hike is still possible this year due to further projected economic improvements.\n\n\"\u2018Keep calm and carry on' is still our message when it comes to the pound's medium-term bullish trajectory,\" Viraj Patel of ING said. \"While the pound has been feeling the heat this week after a string of data misses and cautious BOE policy comments, we're not inclined to call time on the rally just yet; put differently, it may be getting hot in here, but there's no need to take your positions off just yet.\"\n\nMeanwhile, investor demand for UK government bonds \u2014 or gilts \u2014 has increased this week, not least due to the moderating growth expectations.

Previously, CFIUS could restrict foreign takeovers; now its authority could be expanded to outbound investments in joint ventures in foreign countries including China.\n\nMei recalled that in 2017 \"China applied restrictive measures by barring a number of irrational investments in the US.\"\n\n\"However, today China has already begun to ease the measures that it adopted last year; as a result, the volume of direct Chinese investments abroad has resumed its growth,\" the Chinese academic highlighted. \"On the other hand, the US government restrictions imposed on investments of Chinese enterprises and operations for the absorption and merger of high-tech enterprises have come into effect.\"\n\nAccording to Xu Feibiao, analyst at the Center for World Economy Studies of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, \"the peak of Chinese investment in the US was attained in 2016, exceeding the unprecedented mark of $40 billion.\"\n\nThe analyst explained that due to a series of regulations adopted by Beijing in 2017 to tackle economic problems, Chinese investments in mergers and acquisitions in the US market have decreased to $20 billion.\n\n\"In the next three years, measures aimed at preventing risks will be one of China's main tasks; the regulation of investments could also be continued, therefore, the trend towards reducing investments in the US will remain in place,\" Xu presumed.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2018 / JOHN THYS EU Mulls Joining US in Trade War With China in Return for Easing Tariffs - Reports\n\nHe highlighted that Sino-American trade frictions are yet another major reason for this trend: The US government has placed a lot of barriers in the way of Chinese investors planning mergers and purchases of high-tech enterprises.\n\nThe Chinese analyst emphasized that not only the US but also European states have recently targeted Chinese investments in mergers and acquisitions. \"The EU has even gone so far as to adopting a new framework regulating foreign investments,\" Xu pointed out.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Manu Fernandez Chief executive officer of consumer devices division for Huawei Technologies Co.

For its part, Beijing has adopted retaliatory steps affecting American imports.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the latest restrictions proposed by the Treasury Department on April 19 may significantly limit American partnerships with Chinese companies abroad, most notably in the high-tech sphere.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed by the contributors do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/world/201804201063761962-armenia-opposition-protests-detention/", "published": "2018-04-20T17:00:00", "title": "Over 200 People Detained as Anti-Government Protests in Armenia Enter Eighth Day", "text": "YEREVAN (Sputnik) - There have now been a total of 233 people detained in Yerevan during the ongoing protests against the appointment of ex-President Serzh Sargsyan as prime minister, Armenian police spokesman Edgar Dzhanoyan told Sputnik on Friday.\n\n\"As of now 233 people were delivered to police departments,\" Dzhanoyan said.\n\nREAD MORE: Armenian Police Trying to Disperse Protesters in Yerevan\n\nThe protesters are detained upon their attempts to block the streets of the city, a Sputnik correspondent said.

According to the newspaper Irish Times, it\u2019s unknown how the sanctions will influence the plant or whether the storage of bauxite is enough for the plant to keep working despite the sanctions.

The company owns mines, refineries and smelters not only in Russia, but also all over the world, for example in Ireland and Jamaica.

Sputnik looks at this case and two other instances of the shameless use of children in the war for the hearts and minds of the Western public.\n\nBoy Discredits Video Which Led to Western Airstrikes\n\nThe alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, Eastern Ghouta on April 7 by Syrian government forces prompted the US, France and Britain to launch massed naval and air missile strikes against Syria on April 14. Amid the scanty 'evidence' used to justify the strikes was a video from a local hospital purporting to show terrified locals breathing through respirators or pieces of cloth and being covered with water to deal with the aftermath of a suspected gas attack.\n\nHowever, this week, Russian media was able to obtain exclusive testimony from Hassan Diab, an 11-year-old boy featured in the White Helmets video, discovering that he became an unwitting participant in a propaganda stunt.\n\nAccording to the boy, after arriving at the hospital, unknown individuals grabbed him, poured water on him and placed him alongside others for filming. Afterwards, his father said, filmmakers gave Hassan, his mother and the others dates, cookies and rice and released them to their homes.\n\nThe boy's testimony follows that of other eyewitnesses caught in the White Helmets' film, including ambulance driver Khalil Azizah, who revealed last week that the hospital where the video was shot was also treating actual victims from a bombed out residential building.\n\nJihadist Child Abuse\n\nHassan's case is unique in that he actually got a chance to quickly disprove the claims made on his behalf by the White Helmets and their video, with his testimony even picked up by some foreign media. However, it certainly wasn't the first case of the militants fighting the Syrian government to use children as props for regime change.\n\nIn 2016, amid the military's operation to liberate jihadist-held districts in the northwest Syrian city of Aleppo, the photo of Omran Daqneesh, a four-year-old boy injured in the fighting, went viral, and was used extensively in the Western media as a symbol of the Syrian government's alleged horrific disregard for the lives of civilians. Some also used the attack to advocate for US cruise missile strikes against the Syrian military.\n\nWhat was left out of the story was the fact that Omran's father Mohammad is a government supporter and fierce critic of the militants occupying his city. Speaking to Russian media last year, Mohammad revealed that the militants shamelessly filmed his son and put on makeup to exaggerate the extent of his injuries, while Mohammad himself was busy nearby trying to rescue others after their home had been destroyed.\n\nRemember Omran Daqneesh from Aleppo?

Last year, investigative journalist Vanessa Beeley made a trip to Bana's neighborhood in Aleppo, revealing that the girl's family was associated with Nusra Front* (al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate). Locals told Beeley that her father was a Sharia court judge, both Nusra and before that, for Daesh (ISIS)*. Bana's case, according to the journalist was \"complete child exploitation by our governments.\"\n\nOther investigators have also called the Bana narrative into question, pointing to her difficulty with the English language (indicating that someone was obviously helping her with her tweets), and calling into question her aggressive calls for the US to launch an attack on Syria over the operation to free Aleppo.\n\nIrrefutable proof that Bana does not know any English.

Sputnik looks at some pivotal cases subject to intense police spying.\n\nWhile authorities' public admissions did not come replete with a full list of the organizations infiltrated, police chiefs admitted \"the majority\" related to persons of color \u2014 among them many young men who died in custody. Undercover officers, pretending to be concerned members of the public, would approach groups and offer to help out with their campaigns. Here are just some of the groups officers infiltrated.\n\nColin Roach Center\n\nIn some cases, police operatives played crucial, frontline roles in such groups. For instance, under the pseudonym Mark Cassidy, undercover officer Mark Jenner was a key organizer at the Colin Roach Center (CRC), a leading centre of radical activism in Hackney, North London.\n\nThe Center was founded 10 years after the mysterious death of Colin Roach inside the foyer of Stoke Newington police station January 12, 1983. Police claimed the 21-year-old had committed suicide, but family, friends and local residents suspected foul play, as he'd been shot in the back of the head.\n\nCRC quickly became home to a number of community and family justice campaigns, many of which were individually targeted by the Special Demonstrations Squad. One associated campaign was the The Hackney Community Defence Association, which had been successfully highlighting police corruption in the borough \u2014 to the point local police were constantly losing court cases.\n\nJenner turned up at CRC early 1995, attending events and meetings. According to Mark Metcalf, coordinator for the Center, within weeks he'd \"thrown himself into virtually every area of the centre's political life\" and began writing for its internal bulletin and quarterly magazine.\n\n\"As the owner of a van he could also be relied upon to transport people and equipment to meetings and ensure they got home safely afterwards. Always polite and happy to help out, he soon became well liked and respected,\" Metcalf recalls.\n\nHe is said to have taken a particular interest in justice groups there, in particular the campaign behind Malcolm Kennedy, a man wrongfully convicted of manslaughter in Hammersmith Police Station in December 1990. Jenner's pivotal position in CRC would also have allowed him to harvest information on protest actions and other issues of interest to authorities.\n\nStephen Lawrence\n\nPerhaps most infamously of all, the Metropolitan Police spied on the Stephen Lawrence justice campaign.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS / Hannah McKay Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick speaks during a service ahead of the start of the Police Unity Tour in central London\n\nThe 18-year-old was murdered by a gang of racist thugs in an unprovoked attack in Eltham, south London, in April 1993. A catalog of gravely inept investigative errors, at least in part attributable to the institutionally racist local police force, meant his killers weren't identified, much less brought to justice \u2014 despite their identities being widely known locally.\n\nA popular campaign quickly took root, seeking to bring his killers to justice, and expose police bigotry and ineptitude \u2014 it received overwhelming support from the public, and many politicians and journalists promoted its activities.\n\nIn response, the Metropolitan Police dispatched undercover officers to infiltrate the group \u2014 among them was Peter Francis, who posed as \u2018Pete Black'. He has revealed his mission was to find incriminating information about the campaign, and Lawrence's family and friends, in order to discredit it and them in the eyes of the public.\n\n\"Had I have found anything detrimental \u2014 and newsworthy \u2014 about the Lawrence family, the police, using the media then, would've used that information to smear the family. My superiors were after any intelligence of that order. That was made clear to me. The Lawrences were not unique in this. I would suggest journalists read back some of the information leaked to the press at the time about some these campaigns and seriously question where they came from and why. They should also look back at how some of the tabloids reported the Lawrence death very early on,\" Peter has alleged.\n\nStephen's close friend Duwayne Brooks, the main witness to the murder, was repeatedly arrested in the years afterward. In one instance, he was alleged to have fought during an anti-racist march outside the British National Party headquarters in Welling days after the murder. Although Brooks was charged, the judge dismissed the case against him. Information on his activities was said to have come from undercover officers.\n\nTwo members of the five-strong gang that attacked Stephen and Duwayne were eventually convicted in 2002.\n\nJean Charles de Menezes\n\nOn July 22 2005, Jean Charles, a 27 year old electrician, was executed by armed police on an underground train in South London.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS / Suzanne Plunkett Cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes, Vivian Figueiredo, stands in front of a banner during a memorial service for de Menezes outside Stockwell Underground Station in London, Britain in this July 22, 2015.\n\nThe Brazilian emigrant had been wrongly identified as a potential suspect in the failed July 21 bombing attack. He was followed by undercover police from his home as he left for work \u2014 despite being told to stop Jean Charles from entering the tube network, his pursuers allowed him to enter Stockwell station, and board a train headed for central London.\n\nTwo officers then fired a total of eleven shots at Jean Charles at close range, hitting him seven times in the head and once in the shoulder at close range. An eyewitness later indicated the shots were fired over a thirty-second period, at three second intervals. His body was said to be \"unrecognizable\" afterwards.\n\nWhen the victim's total innocence was quickly established, the Metropolitan Police immediately began disseminating false information, unquestioningly regurgitated by the mainstream media, in order to lend legitimacy to the killing, and raise questions about Jean Charles own conduct. Suggestions he had acted suspiciously on numerous occasions while being followed, was an illegal immigrant, had wires sticking out of his rucksack, and had vaulted the station ticket barriers despite police demands he stop, were just some of the entirely bogus stories circulated in the weeks afterward.\n\nOn August 16 2005, the Jean Charles de Menezes Family Campaign, also known as 'Justice4Jean', was established, calling for a public inquiry into the \"unlawful killing\". It was swiftly infiltrated by undercover officers, in order to track the progress of their campaign, and construct an effective public response in advance.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Matt Dunham Cousins Alessandro Pereira, right, Vivian Figueiredo and friend Erionaldo da Silva, left, observe a minute's silence on the 10-year-anniversary of the death of 27-year-old Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes, shot by British police who thought he was a terrorist in the tense aftermath of deadly 2005 London subway bombings, at Stockwell station in London, Wednesday, July 22, 2015.\n\nNonetheless, the campaign successfully secured an inquest , which uncovered a wide array of serious failures by police. It also found the officers involved in the shooting repeatedly lied to investigators \u2014 but the coroner instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing. The jury settled on an open verdict, and no one was penalized for the killing.\n\nJoy Gardner\n\nOn August 1 1993, the London home of Joy Gardner was raided by immigration officials. When she resisted attempts to put her in a 4-inch wide restraint belt with attached handcuffs she was shackled, gagged, with 13 feet of adhesive tape wrapped round her head. She rapidly suffered respiratory failure and died four days later.\n\nThe case became a cause celebre for civil rights and justice campaigners, and for the first time brought widespread public attention to what human rights lawyer Michael Mansfield called \"the inhumanity of methods used routinely in the execution of deportation orders\" in the UK. Almost inevitably, her family's campaign group was infiltrated by Special Demonstration Squad officers, in an operation overseen by veteran \"spycop\" Bob Lambert.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik / Kit Klarenberg COPS Campaign Stall Outside Royal Court of Justice, London\n\nAs \u2018Bob Robinson', Lambert infiltrated environmental groups throughout the 1980s, fathering a child with a female activist he spied on. In a perverse irony, at the time of her death Joy was studying Media Studies at London Metropolitan University, which would later employ Lambert as a lecturer.\n\nEventually, three police officers involved in the raid were charged with manslaughter. Four separate forensic pathologists concluded the cause of Joy's death was cerebral hypoxia, caused by her gagging \u2014 however, police found another pathologist, Paula Lannas, who was willing to attribute her death to accidental brain damage caused in the struggle. The officers were eventually acquitted.\n\nLater, major questions were raised about the work of Lannas \u2014 during a trial at the Old Bailey in June 1998, she testified bruising on the neck of a 16-month-old child \"resulted from strangulation by the mother's boyfriend.\" The defendant was acquitted when forensic pathologist Iain West testified the post mortem examination had been so \"cack-handed\" the bruising may have been inflicted by Lannas, and the prosecution informed the jury her conclusions were \"suspect\" and could not be relied on as evidence.\n\nMoreover, in May 2000, two men had their convictions for manslaughter quashed when it was disclosed Lannas had testified at their trial the victim had been killed by a stab wound and had no other injuries. Subsequent examination found a potentially fatal skull fracture. A 2001 disciplinary tribunal found Lannas's pathology work \"consistently fell substantially short\" of expected standards and there were \"substantive deficiencies\" in \"her technical approach and medical knowledge.\"\n\nThe official use of gags was banned shortly after, but no admission has ever been made that it was part of the cause of Joy's death \u2014 and despite continuing pressure by campaigners, no coroner's inquest or public inquiry into Joy's death has been held as of April 2018.\n\nBlair Peach\n\nBlair Peach was a popular local organizer and campaigner based in east London. On April 23 1979, he attended a Anti-Nazi League demonstration in Southall, Middlesex \u2014 having broken away from the main demonstration into a side street, he was confronted by Special Patrol Group riot officers, one of whom fractured his skull with a blow from an unauthorized weapon.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2018 / Andrew Cowie An armed British policeman secures terminal 4 at Heathrow airport, London.\n\nIn the ensuing inquest, the coroner dismissed the possibility of an officer killing Peach, ignored accounts from Sikh witnesses, and tried to prevent a jury being instated. Investigators also discounted an internal report which found SPG officers involved possessed unauthorized weaponry and Nazi memorabilia. These officers also refused to cooperate with inquiries and many changed their appearance to impede witnesses ability to identify them. The police's contemporaneous report into Blair's death was published in 2010 \u2014 it identifies \u2018Officer E' as \"almost certainly\" being his killer.\n\nOfficer Alan Murray \u2014 who lied to investigators and refused to take part in identity parades at the time \u2014 has identified himself as \u2018Officer E', although denies killing Peach.

How developed is this route, and what are the wider geopolitical issues?\n\nJeff Schubert, an Australian visiting professor at Moscow's Higher School of Economics joins the program.\n\nJeff starts off the program by describing what CPEC is: \"It's a program to develop Pakistan's infrastructure facilities and give China, particular China's western provinces, Xinjiang in particular, access to the Arabian Sea or more broadly the Indian Ocean.\" Jeff sees CPEC as being not only for exports out of China but for imports, particular of energy into China. The Chinese are clearly worried that in the case of a military confrontation the usual import route for oil through the Malacca Straights could be blocked.\n\nThere are various opinions, Jeff says, as to whether CPEC will actually facilitate another way for China to import oil. \"The border regions between Pakistan and China are very mountainous, and prone to earthquakes, and very cold. Various people are now saying that oil cannot be pumped from the port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, through CPEC into China, or it will be very difficult. The Chinese are very good at coming up with infrastructure solutions and if they spend enough money, it can be done. The alternative is to use rail transport, which may bring in about a quarter of a million barrels a day whereas China imports around 9 million barrels per day\u2026.In a situation, however, where other avenues are blocked, this could be very useful.\"\n\nCPEC at the moment is at a very early stage of development, a pipeline has not yet been built. A discussion ensues as to why China doesn't invest in constructing a pipeline from the Middle East, through Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan into China. Jeff explains that Chinese-Pakistan relations are good, making Pakistan a safe choice. \"The alternative is a multi-country project. If China wants to import oil from Iran, it will need to go through possibly Afghanistan, but what is more likely, is through places like Kazakhstan, and even the Chinese imports of gas from Turkmenistan go through Kazakhstan.\" A direct West-East route at the moment is politically too difficult it seems.\n\nTo the question will the One Belt One Road project will bring Central Asian countries together?, possibly facilitating the construction of an East-West pipeline across the bottom of Asia, so to speak. Jeff says: \"In theory, it makes sense, but whereas Russia wants the Eurasian Economic Union to be the main Central Asian partner of China, the Chinese prefer to do this on a bilateral basis. So, the Chinese have done quite a few deals with Kazakhstan\u2026.Kazakhstan is very important, because any energy imports from Turkmenistan or even Iran go through Kazakhstan. And Kazakhstan itself is becoming a very significant supplier of energy, gas as well as oil, to China. So the pipelines going from Turkmenistan and also Iran go through Kazakhstan and thus avoid the very high mountainous earthquake-prone regions. But once again, I think the Chinese will decide that Kazakhstan is not quite as reliable as Pakistan\u2026\"\n\nCPEC could be a huge opportunity for Pakistan in terms of inward investment. Jeff comments: \"That is the expressed intention, and many Pakistanis have taken that view and welcomed it. There is some fear that the debts that Pakistan racks up to China will be too great, but basically, Pakistan has been plagued by energy shortages, and no government has really been able to get the electricity system working properly, and so there are often power cuts. So, one area of cooperation is the construction of power stations, the other is Special Economic Zones for Chinese entities to do business. The third is the creation of a transportation infrastructure includes roads railways and possible a pipeline\u2026\"\n\nJeff sees the time when China can import millions of barrels of oil via CPEC as being about 15 or 20 years off, so these are very early days, although the planning process and time frames are different when one is talking about China. \"Many aspects are already operating. Gwadar port is already operating, but oil is now imported to China via CPEC by road rather than rail.\" This might not necessarily be a bad thing given the gradients of the terrain.\n\nGwadar could potentially become a Chinese port, \"the agreement now is that the port is only for commercial vessels, but obviously the Chinese have in mind naval vessels as well\u2026.the problem for India is that they realise that Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and is very close. I don't think India is going to do anything like attack Gwadar or blockade it. The Indian strategy is to develop better relationships with Iran, Iran is a developing a new port called Chabahar which would allow India to access Central Asia via Iran\u2026\" This is somewhat surprising given Iran's present relationship with the United States.\n\nAs far as Afghanistan goes, Jeff says that the US is increasingly blaming Pakistan for American failure in Afghanistan, and the Americans have been trying to encourage the Indians to take a greater role in Afghanistan. \"But how does India get into Afghanistan \u2014 through Pakistan, which really is an ironic situation. So, they are not talking about India taking an increasing military role, but they are talking about increased training, increase general support\u2026 my own view is that US policy on Afghanistan is very confused. They want to leave but they don't know how to. One of their ideas is to get India involved, and India is in a way happy to do that because India feels Pakistan promotes the Taliban as a possible way to get at India in the future.\"\n\nAn interesting discussion follows regarding the societal make up of Pakistan, and it becomes clear that Pakistan is a very complex country, with many different political, economic and religious stakeholders.\n\nClearly, CPEC is a fascinating project, however the project is complex, and as it now begins to come on line, it will change the face of Asia. This is only one of the many major infrastructure projects taking place in Asia, which the West has perhaps failed to give due attention to as we are constantly distracted by local political and military issues.\n\nWe'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com"}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/201804201063752830-immigrant-denied-french-passport-muslim/", "published": "2018-04-20T13:02:30", "title": "Woman Denied French Passport for 'Expressly Refusing' to Shake Officials' Hands", "text": "The gesture indicated a lack of assimilation and inability to fully integrate into French society, France\u2019s Highest Court has found.\n\nA woman was denied a French passport after refusing to shake hands with high-profile French municipal officials at a formal citizenship ceremony in the city of Isere, South-Eastern France.\n\nThe Muslim Algerian, who is married to a French national, had applied for a French passport, and during a formal event \"expressly refused to shake hands with the secretary-general of the prefecture and another local official,\" according to a case heard by France's highest court, the Conseil d'Etat (State Council).\n\nREAD MORE: Refugees Illegally Sell Their European IDs Online \u2014 Reports\n\nThe court statement was published on the French government's justice website LegiFrance.

In 2015 the town was up in arms at its portrayal by Sacha Baron Cohen in the comedy, Grimsby.\n\nBut there is hope at hand.\n\nIn October last year North East Lincolnshire Council granted it Conservation Area status and plans are afoot by Associated British Ports (ABP) \u2014 who own the majority of the land \u2014 to renovate the area.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik / Chris Summers The Kasbah area of Grimsby was once thriving but is now largely derelict\n\n'Fantastic News for Grimsby'\n\n\"This is fantastic news for Grimsby. The Kasbah is a very special place that has huge potential for regeneration,\" said Louise Brennan, Planning Director, East Midlands at Historic England at the time.\n\n\"Across the country, developers and businesses are repairing and reusing historic buildings, turning local history into economic success. We believe that making the Kasbah into a Conservation Area will help make this happen in Grimsby,\" she added.\n\nBut with Brexit due to come into force in March 2019, Grimsby will not be able to call on the huge amounts of European Union regeneration grants which have breathed life into other UK towns.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik / Chris Summers Grimsby remains a major fish processing center but most of the fish is imported\n\nGrimsby Voted for Brexit\n\nIn the June 2016 referendum around 70 percent of people in Grimsby voted for Brexit.\n\nNick Triplow, the author of Distant Water: Stories from Grimsby's Fishing Fleet, explained why the area is so anti-European.\n\n\"There remains a hefty UKIP vote and there was a big majority for Brexit. The context for that is that many people still blame the EU for the demise of the fishing industry,\" Mr. Triplow told Sputnik.\n\nEarlier this year former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and other campaigners dumped fish in the Thames near the Houses of Parliament in protest at Theresa May's inability to free Britain from the Common Fisheries Policy during the Brexit transition period.\n\nBut Mr. Triplow said it was unrealistic to think the British fishing industry could be salvaged after Brexit.\n\n'Pipedream' To Expect UK Fishing Fleet to Return\n\n\"Right up until the mid-1980s Grimsby was a huge fishing port but it's a pipedream to think it could be resurrected. There are no fish stocks anyway and it would depend on huge investment. Where's that going to come from?\" Mr. Triplow told Sputnik.\n\nHe said there had been many different schemes over the years to breathe new life into the Kasbah area but each had come to nought.\n\n\"The land is owned by ABP so you need their consent to do anything but previous regeneration bids were always scuppered by them. They were simply more focused on the new car dock and bringing in timber and they weren't engaged with the regeneration process at that time,\" Mr. Triplow told Sputnik.\n\nBut Dafydd Williams, head of communications and corporate affairs with ABP Humber, said ABP Grimsby's port had a \"major role to play\" in the town's future.\n\n\"The Kasbah is a great example of this as the historic buildings have the potential to attract new jobs and growth for the local area with the right investment and support. ABP is delighted to be working closely with North East Lincs Council and Historic England to help to make better use of the Kasbah whilst preserving its heritage for future generations. We are looking forward to working side by side with the local council in the hope of bringing new business across to the region,\" Mr. Williams told Sputnik.\n\n\u00a9 RIA Novosti . Sputnik/Chris Summers A man fillets fish in one of the few remaining workshops in Grimsby's Kasbah district\n\nAn ABP spokesperson said there was a common misconception that to have a business on the port estate in Grimsby, companies had to be related to the maritime industry.\n\n\"We haven't specifically explored EU regeneration money at this stage, but we are open to any sources of funding that will help to deliver our ambitions for the future of Grimsby,\" the ABP spokesperson told Sputnik.\n\nA spokesman for North East Lincolnshire Council said they had drafted a Greater Grimsby Town Deal, which included ambitious plans to grow the local economy by more than \u00a3216 million per year.\n\nThey hoped to build 7,700 homes and create 5,400 jobs and they said key to this was \"a new higher education presence, waterfront housing, cultural and leisure facilities through the redevelopment of historic sites including the Silo at Victoria Mills and the Kasbah Conservation Area at the Port of Grimsby.\"\n\nAll fine words, but the people of Grimsby have heard them all before.\n\n\"Whether there would have been European money if it weren't for Brexit is a moot point but there was an opportunity to do it in the early 2000s and ABP weren't engaged. You still need a whole lot of private funding,\" Mr. Triplow told Sputnik.\n\nThe views of the speaker do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/201804201063751344-anti-semitism-germany-video-refugee/", "published": "2018-04-20T12:27:42", "title": "Suspect From Anti-Semitic Video Which Stirred Germany Gives Himself Up to Police", "text": "The country which has experienced the biggest influx of refugees since 2015 is facing the fact that the alleged attacker has turned out to be a Syrian teenager. The revealed facts about the perpetrator of the attack have fueled debates about imported Muslim anti-Semitism in Germany.\n\nA 19-year-old Syrian man turned himself in to Berlin police as the perpetrator of the attack, which has made headlines in Germany and abroad as an anti-Semitic assault.\n\nThe police spokesperson, cited by the Euronews, stated that the suspect came to Germany from Syria as a refugee. Being registered in the federal state of Brandenburg, he doesn\u2019t have a permanent residence in Berlin. His motives, however, haven\u2019t been clarified by the police.\n\nHe allegedly whipped two young men wearing Jewish skullcaps in a posh district of Berlin with a belt, crying out the Arabic word for Jew, \"Yahudi.\" Although the attack was branded anti-Semitic, the victims turned out to have no Jewish background. One of them is an Israeli citizen, according to the DW broadcaster, but he came from an Arab family. The other one has a German citizenship and Moroccan origins.\n\nBoth young men got kippahs as gifts and wore them like some kind of social experiment to find out if it was safe to wear this Jewish symbol publicly in Germany. According to one of them, they didn\u2019t believe it could provoke any anti-Semitic response. The young men were caught off guard as they were taking selfies, which allowed them to film the attack and posted it online.\n\nThe video soon went viral and triggered a stormy reaction from the Jewish community and German authorities about the rise of bigotry and anti-Semitism in the country.\n\nAfter the clip emerged, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the incident was \u201cabsolutely dreadful\u201d and promised that any form of anti-Semitism would be dealt with firmly and decisively. She also pointed out at the dual nature of anti-Semitism, as it finds support both among German nationals and in the Arabic-speaking community.\n\nGerman Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas also condemned the deed.\n\nWenn junge M\u00e4nner bei uns attackiert werden, nur weil sie eine Kippa tragen, ist das unertr\u00e4glich.

Jews shall never again feel threatened here.

But there was always anti-Semitism here. The problem didn't start in 2015.\"\n\nThe latest stats, issued by RIAS recently, show that the number of anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 was double that recorded in 2016.

Russia, he said, was \"interested in a fair investigation\" by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in Syria.\n\nYakovenko said that the civilian casualties from the US, French and British strike would have been unimaginable had Syrian air defenses not managed to shoot down 71 of the missiles, discrediting the UK's justification that the strikes were a 'measured response' to Syria's alleged chemical weapons use. Furthermore, he said, the strikes did not constitute self-defense by the UK, and were not authorized by the UN Security Council.\n\nThe ambassador also pointed out that among the three alleged 'chemical weapons' sites hit by the US-led coalition, none showed signs of contamination following the attack. This, he said, confirms that the pretext of chemical weapons use by the government was false.\n\nAfter the #airstrikes by US, UK, France in #Syria there was no contamination of the surrounding area, leading us to conclude that the pretext to the strikes was false https://t.co/JB9aNHTcrZ pic.twitter.com/KEz54UbWYm \u2014 Sputnik UK (@SputnikNewsUK) 20 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f 2018 \u0433.\n\nYakovenko added that when Russian military police were deployed to Douma, they could not find any evidence of chemical weapons use.\n\nSkripal Case\n\nTurning to the Skripal case, the ambassador reiterated that London is continuing to ignore Moscow's legitimate requests for information regarding the status of Sergei and Yulia.

Pressure on them cannot be ruled out. They checked only the sites designated by the UK beforehand,\" the ambassador said.\n\nAll this was a sign that the Skripal case was a provocation against Russia, he added, with Moscow blamed for the attack \"almost the next day,\" without any evidence provided.\n\nAbsence of dialogue by the British side on #Skripal case makes us think something is wrong and conclude that it was a huge provocation against #Russia \u2014 @Amb_Yakovenko in London https://t.co/JB9aNHTcrZ pic.twitter.com/L1klKsovIj \u2014 Sputnik UK (@SputnikNewsUK) 20 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f 2018 \u0433.\n\nThe ambassador reiterated a sentiment he expressed at last week's press conference, urging the British media to ask the government to arrange a meeting with the Skripals as evidence of their status.

Furthermore, he noted, in recent days there have been numerous calls in the UK's media about the need to prepare for an 'inevitable' Russian cyberattack, again without any proof being presented.\n\nThe ambassador recalled that on April 11, Home Secretary Amber Rudd claimed that the UK's National Cybersecurity Center had reported 49 incidents associated with Russian cyber groups allegedly targeting energy, telecommunications and media. Russia is \"disappointed that such serious claims have been made publically, without any proof being presented and without any attempt by the United Kingdom to clarify the situation with the Russian side.\" This was a \"reckless, provocative and unfounded policy,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the ambassador, the impression Moscow gets today is that the British public is being prepared for a massive cyberattack by the UK against Russia, and that such an attack may then be presented as a \"response, but will in fact constitute the unprovoked use of force.\" Evidence of this possibility includes the fact that Prime Minister May did not publicly reject the possibility of deploying the UK's offensive cyberwarfare capabilities against Russia in her statement on March 14, he said."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/business/201804201063750442-turkey-central-bank-gold-reserves-us/", "published": "2018-04-20T12:03:44", "title": "Golden Rush-Out: Turkey Extracts Its Bullion Reserves From US", "text": "The total volume of the Turkish Central Bank's gold reserves, which were stored in the United States, stood at 220 tons; last month, Turkey's gold reserves were worth about 25.3 billion dollars.\n\nLocal media cited government sources as saying that the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has transferred its gold reserves from the US Federal Reserve System to Ankara.\n\nIn March 2018, the CBRT's gold reserves were worth 25.3 billion dollars; 220 tons of Turkish gold was stored in the US, according to the sources.\n\nThe largest private Turkish banks also withdrew their gold reserves from abroad, responding to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call \"to get rid of exchange rate's pressure and to use gold against the dollar.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 95% of Turkey's Population Oppose Alliance With NATO, US \u2013 Former General\n\nIn particular, the Halk Bankasi bank transferred 29 tons of gold to Turkey, according to the Turkish newspaper Milliyet.\n\nRelations between Turkey and the US have become aggravated against the backdrop of Washington's support for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Syria, seen by Ankara as a terrorist group linked to Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) also blacklisted by Turkish government as a terrorist organization.

In late May, the parties to the agreement agreed to extend the deal until the end of March 2018. Another extension was made in late November that would make the deal remain in effect until the end of 2018."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/europe/201804201063747139-lycamobile-taxman-conservatives-raid/", "published": "2018-04-20T10:50:00", "title": "Labour's John McDonnell Demands to Know Why No Raid on Tory Donors Lycamobile", "text": "The British government, and their tax authorities, have been urged to explain why the UK offices of the communications firm Lycamobile were not raided despite a request by French police.

So they nurture a grudge against Russia and they have some sleeper cells in Russian republics and they have some local support over there. They have also links with LeT and some other terror groups in this region. Somehow Russians have been able to suppress the Chechen movement but there are not dead but only their numbers have reduced.

Upon reaching full swing, the factory is expected to catch as much as 100 metric tons of starfish every day.\n\nIn addition to being a cheap and reliable source of feed, the initiative is said to offer a number of other benefits, such as alleviating oxygen depletion in Limfjorden while also providing better conditions for the farming of mussels, which the starfish prey upon. Yet another environmental benefit is avoiding the release of substances that starfish emit when they die.\n\n\"Starfish are an eminent source of protein for animals and it's all the nicer if we are able to find raw goods locally in Denmark and transform them into high-value protein for our organic animals, rather than import protein from countries like China,\" Danish Marine Protein head Niels J\u00f8rgen Madsen told Danish Radio.\n\nREAD MORE: Pig in the Middle: Danes Divided Over Huge 'Anti-Swine' Fence Against Germany\n\nAt present, much of the protein feed consumed within Danish agriculture is imported from China.

This country was named by [Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor] Konashenkov; we mean the UK. What proof will we provide of Britain's culpability and when will we do so?\n\nLavrov: You know, there is already plenty of evidence in principle. To begin with, this is the video from which it all began and which was probably the main reason and the main pretext for that feverish attack that the Americans, Britons and French staged, launching airstrikes at chemical weapons production and storage facilities, as they alleged. Probably, even an ordinary person can understand that if you know where a chemical weapons depot is located, bombing the facility means only one thing: creating a humanitarian catastrophe for those who live in the area.\n\nThe video clearly shows unprotected people, except, perhaps, some of them wearing gauze bandages, pour water on boys and some adults. When liberating this part of Eastern Ghouta, our military found two doctors who worked in this hospital and these doctors showed themselves on this video, talking about how some people broke in and began to shout: \"chemical attack, you must immediately pour water on yourself! \" And it was honestly said by those doctors, who did not hide their faces and who identified themselves.\n\nREAD MORE: WATCH Syrian Boy in White Helmets FAKE Chemical Attack Video Reveals Truth\n\nBy the way, I recently watched Euronews; if I'm not mistaken, they showed a woman who had everything \u2014 both face and the body \u2014 covered, there was only a narrow slit for her eyes.

Therefore, the information we see should be analyzed very carefully, especially now.

I do not want to rule anything out, but I also do not want to blame anyone for anything without a reason.\n\nBut emotionally and as a human being, what did you feel when you saw this eleven-year-old boy named Hassan Diab tremble as he was doused with cold water from a hose by adults who then started to inject something into his mouth. It seems they wanted to intimidate him, something his father said later.\n\nLavrov: Like Stanislavsky, I wanted to shout: \"I do not believe it!\" But as far as more human feelings are concerned, it is, of course, disgusting, when children are used for dirty tricks.\n\nSputnik: You have a lot of experience, including work at Russia's permanent mission to the UN Security Council. Can you imagine that this boy, Hassan Diab, and his father can appear in the Security Council and tell their story as witnesses? Or should they be given Syrian diplomatic passports for this? Will the world really hear these people given that they are key witnesses and participants in the events?\n\nLavrov: It would be useful, and of course, we would support such actions, which should first of all be taken by the Syrian government. Our Western colleagues often resort to such inclusions in the Security Council's agenda, where they discuss representatives of civil society from \"the site,\" when it comes to the fact that there are witnesses to a particular action that is being considered.\n\nSputnik: So this practice does exist?\n\nLavrov: Yes. They bring representatives of various NGOs; they brought Syrians and Iranians (can't remember from which organization though), they host video conferences. So the existing technical capabilities allow the opinion of people who witnessed certain events to be brought to the attention of UN Security Council members during open sessions. Speaking of which, we will continue to insist on that, even in situations not related to Syria. Eyewitnesses would have the ability to address the Security Council members. But in this particular case, it is a Syrian government matter, and we would actively support such a proposition.\n\nREAD MORE: The Violent Reality of 'Western Propaganda Construct' White Helmets\n\nSputnik: In any case, the father said that they're willing to go anywhere and testify to anyone.\n\nLavrov: Yes, I heard that.\n\nOne way or another, this staged provocation ended up in massive missile airstrikes, and, it must be noted, a very effective counter-response to the attack. Well, this is the first such episode in the history of humanity. How detailed was the first notice of the planned missile attack and how early did Russia get it? Did we have an opportunity to draw \"red lines\" around some areas? Literally, \"red lines\" on the map? How decisive would we have been, if the missiles hadn't flown to the areas we were informed about? Were we ready to shoot down the planes and sink enemy ships?\n\nLavrov: Before the plans for the strike of the Western trio started to take shape, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov clearly stated that if any military action taken by the so-called coalition harmed Russian army forces, it would be met by a tough and clear response. And we would not only see the rockets, but also their carrier as legitimate targets. It was said clearly and explicitly.\n\nAnd, by the way, I'm stunned how some of our Western colleagues and some of mine, too, and some of our mass media turned their attention to our ambassador to Lebanon Zasypkin, who repeated what the Chief of the General Staff said. They tried to put words into his mouth, that if just one missile flew over Syrian territory from the coalition forces, we would sink ships and so on and so forth. The Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov had only warned that this would happen if Russian forces were harmed. After this, contact was made at the top level in the army, at the level of the generals, between our representatives and the heads of of the US-led coalition. They were informed of where our \"red lines\" were, including the \"red lines\" located \"on the territory,\" geographically. And, in any case, the results show that these \"red lines\" were not crossed.\n\nSpeaking about the results of these strikes, they are also called into question. Our US colleagues state that all the missiles reached their targets, as did the French ones. Our General Staff has a clear picture; we watched everything in real time, live. We are ready to answer for the stats given by our military forces. If somebody states that all the 105 rockets reached their targets, they should present their stats. At least, proof that our analysis, our count has a basis in fact, which will be revealed by our military forces very soon, as I understand.\n\nREAD MORE: WATCH Top Russian General Predict Douma Provocation a Month in Advance\n\nSputnik: Very soon?\n\nLavrov: I hope.\n\nSputnik: 103 missiles were launched, 71 of them were shot down. Trump said that he called somebody to ask if all the rockets reached their targets, and the person on the other end of the line said \"yes-yes, every one of them, Mr. President.\" Whom could he call?\n\nLavrov: I don't know whom, in such cases, the President of the United States calls. Our President doesn't have to call \u2014 he's reported to, when such things happen. And I would prefer not to meditate on the theme of relations inside the US Administration or how some officials in Washington treat the position and orders of their President.\n\nWill we supply S-300 (air defense systems) to Syria?\n\nLavrov: The President spoke about this. We have no moral obligations now. We used to have moral obligations, we promised not to do that some 10 years ago, as far as I remember, at the request of our known partners, and we took their argument into account, that it would lead to destabilization, although (these air defense systems are) purely defensive. We nevertheless heeded their requests, but we don't have this moral obligation now.\n\nSputnik: You say that you don't like the standing inside the US administration, but nevertheless, with the current configuration, when the most sensible \"dove\" in the White House is \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, the circumstances are such that we're not far from a military clash between Russia and the US. How big is the risk of such a clash?\n\nLavrov: I still think that Defense Minister Mattis, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Danford understand the unacceptability of any actions which could provoke a direct military clash between Russia and the US. It's so obvious, that the military officials can't but understand it, and they understand it better than many others. When the politicians try to goad, if you excuse my blunt words, the leaders of their countries, insisting on more and more confrontation, including outright confrontation, they are not acting responsibly. They reach, or try to reach their inner political goals; the inter-party struggle goes on there, and this is reflected in Congress; there are speculations regarding the Russian agenda, with the understanding that Russophobia may serve as a basis for unity. But this campaign has ebbed. It was artificially fueled by the unprecedented sanctions, and relied on them to compel us to accept their conditions for the further development of the relations. This was na\u00efve and short-sighted, to say the least. What do they talk about? [They say they] want good relations with Russia, but for this Russia should acknowledge all its sins and mistakes, in other words, they take their own impeccability as a starting point.\n\nREAD MORE: Pentagon Has No Indication Syria Will Conduct a \"Chemical Attack\"\n\nThey maintain that only Russia is to blame for anything which is going on now, as it acts to countermine them and behaves as a revisionist power, undermining the existing world order. By this world order, they don't mean the UN Charter, they understand it to mean what they think they need to save; they're trying to save its dominance. I understand that several centuries ago, the historical West, as we call it, acted on its own accord in the world. Now that there are centers of power in Asia and Latin America, and actually the Russian Federation, which is one of the key players on the world arena now, they don't like that others are trying to stand up for their own interests. Notably, we don't stand for our interests uncompromisingly; we suggest looking for a balance of interests, reaching a consensus. However, they say that they are only going to talk when you concede that you agree with how the world is organized, by their rules. This is what it's all about. Speaking about the risk of a military confrontation, I feel absolutely confident in assuming that the militaries will not allow this, and of course neither will President Putin or President Trump. They are leaders, after all, elected by their people and responsible for their peace.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Hassan Ammar War in Syria 'Is Not Over by a Long Shot,' Analyst Explains Why\n\nI find Russia's composure and self-restraint of Russia sincerely inspiring. I've seen a lot, including the \"cold war,\" and I get the impression that if another person was in the Kremlin now, everything could turn other way round, because the provocations seem to follow one another, and Russia is being provoked, and Russia always refuses to accept the \"cold war\" and the challenge of this kind of sport. Still, you say that it's all decreasing, but I have another feeling, that everything is intensifying. The intensity increases, and the direct lie is becoming a tool in foreign affairs. Take for instance, Boris Johnson, or our (British) partners who don't want to listen to or even hear us. In my office, I have TV screens showing \"Rossiya 24,\" BBC and CNN. \"Rossiya 24\" had a story on with the 11-year-old boy, who became an involuntary actor in that video, telling us what it was like, and how he was given dates, biscuits and rice. It seems like the false flag has been revealed, but at the same time the BBC story has the same clip [of the alleged chemical attack] on, like nothing has happened. What should happen so that this easing of tensions begins?\n\nLavrov: I didn't say that the campaign is declining; I said it's losing its momentum. You know, when a person runs 100 meters, or 10K, even better, a 42 km, he's breathing more and more heavily, but he keeps on running and running. So his strength leaves him in the end. I think we see the same process now, although those who want to play out this Russophobic campaign, also wish for it to gain momentum, but you can and you definitely will strain yourself. And you are absolutely right. I'm convinced that one should react with dignity. We can't but respond when our property is taken or our diplomats expelled \u2014 otherwise, it would mean we had no self-respect. But getting into quarrels, rows and brutality is not our president's style, and we are not going to do it. He's always looking forward, and it's very hard, if not impossible at all, to throw him off balance, and they try to do exactly this thing. They try to throw somebody off his stride, throw him off calmness, confidence, to ruin our plans that we should bring into life at home, and there are plenty of them. But I repeat one more time that when we are shouted at, a famous wisdom pearl comes to mind \"Jupiter, you are angry, then you are wrong.\" However, one doesn't really see Jupiter there, but\u2026\n\nSputnik: Yes, so complimentary. However, it was recently revealed that Trump has invited Putin to the White House. Has there been any update about the time and the place of the meeting, or its agenda?\n\nLavrov: We base our assumptions on the fact that during a phone conversation, which has already been revealed to the public, the US President extended this invitation and said that he'd be glad to welcome him in the White House and to meet with him during a return visit. And he broached this topic again on several occasions, so we let our American colleagues know that we don't want to seem intrusive, but we don't want to appear impolite either, and considering the fact that President Trump made this proposal, we assume that he'll make it more specific.\n\nSputnik: And then it all was left hanging in in the air?\n\nLavrov: Well, yes. The word got out.\n\nSputnik: So?\n\nLavrov: President Putin is ready for such meeting.\n\nSputnik: Is this meeting being prepared or not?\n\nLavrov: Not yet. But if there will be any future developments, we'll definitely tell you. I'll just point out that after this phone conversation, Donald Trump mentioned several times, verbally and via Twitter, that they need to solve issues with Russia, that they want to enjoy good relations with Russia, which is better than not having good relations, and that only a fool would think otherwise. And we hear all that.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump Still Willing to Meet Putin Despite Rising US-Russia Tension \u2014 White House\n\nSputnik: But at the same time Mike Pence said that the US will strive to achieve military supremacy in space, over Russia among others. Will it lead to an arms race in space? How does Russia intend to respond to this development?\n\nLavrov: For many years the United States has remained the only state to block negotiations proposed via a Russian-Chinese initiative at the disarmament conference in Geneva, on developing a treaty that would ban the deployment of weapons in space. This is not about preventing the militarization of space, as military satellites are already being launched by us, the US and other countries; this is a separate matter. But deploying weapons in space would be risky, and it would lead to unpredictable new threats. So we and the Chinese offered to make such treaty. Everyone is ready to begin negotiations \u2014 it would clearly be a difficult process, but we have a draft; it's pretty well-developed, and we're ready to discuss each of its points and willing to seek the wording that would gain everyone's approval and make the document ready for signing. The US alone blocks this undertaking. In the meantime, we perfectly understand the danger of this trend and, while the conditions for making a legally binding document come to a head, we advance the following political concept: we call upon everyone to declare that no country will become the first to deploy weapons in space.\n\nThere is a corresponding resolution we're submitting to the UN General Assembly. It needs to be adopted by a substantial majority of votes; the US is against it and many of their allies seek to abstain during voting. But this problem exists. And of course if these threats become real, we need to prepare for certain actions which would help avoid the worst-case scenarios \u2014 the ones involving the destruction of ground targets from space. This is a big problem, which also includes the matter of anti-satellite weaponry. The sooner these talks begin at the disarmament conference in Geneva, involving both diplomats and military officials, the better it will be for all of mankind.\n\nAs for the statement made by Mike Pence regarding the need for military supremacy in space, it is hardly surprising, considering the fact that the US refuses to take part in the talks I've mentioned. And they seek supremacy everywhere: not just in space, but on land and in the air as well. It is written in their doctrinal documents. So there's hardly anything new here, though I must point out again that using this logic in space will pose a serious risk for all of mankind.\n\nSputnik: At least for now, Americans do not feel any restrictions and just working on domination. Probably, Russia should also do so because there are no restrictions?\n\nLavrov: Of course we see what our American colleagues are doing and of course we do not have the right to turn a blind eye to it.\n\nREAD MORE: Truth Lost in London Fog: Top Three Strange New Details in Skripal Case\n\nSputnik: If we return to this theme of chemicals, albeit on English soil, this story with the BZ, does this intrigue you? According the newest information, we are told that BZ was artificially produced at a Swiss lab [samples] to check their professionalism, competence and so on. Something like this\u2026\n\nLavrov: Well, it's explained that it was done on purpose to check the professionalism of those who will conduct this analysis. But I don't want to go into the details now. After all, most of the report is confidential. But it's well known that, when turning to the OPCW for technical support, the British didn't only give them a sample of the substance from the scene, but also said \"here is the sample, find this chemical substance.\" So this was ordered. As for the OPCW experts who conducted this technical function, they confirmed that it was exactly the same substance the British told them about, but that the substance was in a very pure form, with a very high concentration, which means that it had been injected into this sample literally just before the analysis. If had been a couple of weeks old, it would have metabolized partly and had a different texture.\n\nAlong with this, at least the Swiss laboratory in the town of Spiez found some quantity of the substance BZ along with the ordered substance. BZ belongs to the second category of substances. According to the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons, it's a less dangerous substance than those in the first category.\n\nThere are a lot of questions there, and we want to get answers for them. If what we are being told about this substance, this BZ, is true, explain this to us then. Probably, when such questions rise, we would like to look at the initial results of the analysis, not only from the lab in Spiez, but from the other three labs, where the samples were sent to at the same time.\n\nIt also became known that the OPCW experts didn't take the samples in places they chose, but those pointed out by the British.\n\nSputnik: Actually, from Britons' hands.\n\nLavrov: From Britons' hands or in their presence. Also, there was no independent examination of the patients by OPCW physicians, namely, everyone only relied on British doctors. And it would be good if Britons were transparent in their further actions and if they showed the results of their own investigations. But they keep the lid on everything, just as they earlier classified the Litvinenko case. So the questions are certainly accumulating.\n\nWe formulated almost five dozen questions, which are purely professional. In response, they say: \"No, you first answer our questions.\" And they have one question, or rather two: \"Was Putin ordered to do this or did you just lose control over your chemical arsenal?\"\n\nWhat chemical arsenal? The one which was destroyed and verified by the OPCW as having already been destroyed with the approval of the entire international community?\n\nThey began to lodge charges, with an assistant to the Prime Minister writing an open letter to NATO's Secretary General. Why on Earth? In this letter he gives the data, which, they believe, should convince everyone of the correctness of London's arguments and accusations against us.\n\nAmong other things, the letter alleges that a chemical weapons program in Russia was secretly carried out in the 2000s. Something was destroyed in line with the OPCW demands, but there was still a secret program, which was personally supervised by Putin. But if this is so, if they knew about it all the time \u2014 come to the OPCW and ring the alarm, demanding that we should be nailed. They were silent.\n\nThis letter also alleges that the method, poisoning people by applying poisonous substances to door handles, was designed with our know-how, and that it was a long time ago. But if they knew this when they immediately accused us of poisoning the Skripals? Why did they remember about the door handle only four weeks after the Salisbury incident, examining instead a taxi, a bench, or a restaurant. That is, it is another inconsistency which adds to more similar things.\n\nAdditionally, they allege the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff has kept an eye on Yulia Skripal's emails for year. But to claim this, one also need to monitor her emails. So in this case, the more they try to justify themselves, the more questions arise.\n\nWell, if they take a sample and do something with it, injecting BZ or something else. Namely, it refers to the sample, so to say, familiarly. Moreover, the correctness of testing the sample has not been confirmed by the OPCW. That is, they first inject something and then give it to the OPCW, which is a foolish position in general. What did they investigate then?\n\nLavrov: I do not claim that they have injected it, that they tried to mislead.\n\nSputnik: But they said it themselves, that they were injecting BZ.\n\nLavrov: Yes. But we want to understand how it fits the procedures, because what we now know about how OPCW was received in Britain at London's invitation and the way OPCW worked there \u2014 it all does not fit those very strict procedures outlined by the Chemical Weapons Convention. But we aren't accusing anyone. We asked several dozen questions and we want them answered. We want those answers delivered by adults and professionals, we want a professional dialogue. I don't know, maybe we'll have to wait until there are professionals in the British government. So far, our dialogue [with them] hasn't worked out.\n\nOkay, but here's how things turn out: while the father, as they say, chose his \u2018shady' way of life, Yulia [Skripal] definitely didn't expect that. It appears that she merely went there for a few days to ask her father's blessing for marriage, but things took a different turn. Now somebody writes letters in flawless English using her name, and, basically, she's gone missing. She is a Russian citizen; she didn't expect to stay there [indefinitely], she just renovated her apartment, she has a fianc\u00e9 and a dog, her whole life. How did it happen?\n\nI consider it simply outrageous. We've already sent several official notes demanding that we be allowed to establish personal contact with a Russian citizen, to ensure that everything that the British tell us in her name is true, because so far we aren't certain about it. And you know, it goes beyond not just ethical norms, but legal ones as well.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Misha Japaridze Russian Delegation to OPCW: Induced Coma Was Used to Manipulate Skripals' Health\n\n\"She doesn't want to talk to you,\" that's what she allegedly said. But she did not say it to us directly. She spoke with her cousin \u2014 I think her name is Victoria \u2014 on the phone for about a minute and a half. Victoria talked about it in several interviews, and she said she was alarmed by the way Yulia was talking. So if Yulia doesn't want to talk to us, we want her to tell us herself. There are many instances when our citizens travel abroad or end up in trouble and we want to provide them with consular assistance which they refuse \u2014 but they refuse it during a personal meeting. So let it be just 10 seconds, let her say \"thank you very much, but I don't require your services.\"\n\nAs for Sergei Skripal, as you've said, he chose his own path. As you know, he was convicted and served his sentence for about four years. And then a group of people who were spying for the US and Britain were exchanged for what we call \u2018Chapman's group'. When that exchange took place, he was released and travelled to his new homeland, and was doing well for himself. So if anyone in the Russian Federation wanted to get rid of him \u2014 as they say now, we apparently were the only ones with a motive \u2014 why would we exchange him for our men?\n\nYou know, I have many friends in intelligence, and I value our relationship and their job. So when I hear now how some of our, shall we say, political analysts, regrettably claim that it's our sacred duty to eliminate defectors, it is insulting to the intelligence community of any country in the world, because in any intelligence service in the world, they will tell you this: if a man was exchanged, you can't harm him. Case closed. All intelligence officers know that.\n\nREAD MORE: Russia Expects Answer From OPCW About BZ Toxin Presence in Skripal Case\n\nSputnik: I didn't imply that he should've been eliminated. He chose his way in life and his partners. It is these very partners who are now doing what they please with him. And as for Yulia\u2026 do promises get \u2018exhausted' here?\n\nLavrov: Here?\n\nSputnik: Yes, you said that this Douma story was getting exhausted in many aspects. How about this case?\n\nLavrov: At least, if one analyzes the fact that they are responding to our concrete questions by brushing aside everything as fiction and repeating the same mantra that no one has the combined experience, or rather capability to produce such a substance, that no one has experience using such a substance unlawfully, and that no one has motives. That is what Boris Johnson says. And there too, you see a complete lack of domain knowledge. They could have asked or provided some professional documents after this month and a half. This so-called \"Novichok,\" classification hasn't been used by us. It has been named so by the West.\n\nYes, we had developments, and one of the developers is this Mirzayanov. He immigrated, left for the United States, and published this formula. This substance has been patented, and was operated or was in use by different biological or chemical institutes as well as by US Army. And it is easily produced. There was recently an OPCW Executive Board meeting and we wondered how a laboratory in this city of Spitz \u2014 as we had found out \u2014 managed to verify that it was exactly this substance. It means that it had a prototype, or, as they call it, marker. They said \u2014 no, the lab received the formula. And this lab just synthesized this substance in a matter of days or even hours. So that means it is an easy job, having the formula, which was published at the end of previous century.\n\nSo it is quite unclear, why no-one can provide the members of the British cabinet, including the Prime Minister, with this info.\n\nSputnik: There is also another global issue that is being widely discussed: the upcoming summit between the two Koreas, and President Trump claiming that he'll meet with Kim Jong-un in the next few weeks. The place for this meeting is being chosen, and Russia has even reportedly offered to hold it on its territory.\n\nLavrov: No, I haven't heard that. Maybe somebody is just fantasizing or speculating. Some European countries were also mentioned, along with Mongolia and a village located on the edge of the DMZ.\n\nSputnik: Are we ready to offer our [territory]?\n\nLavrov: No. I don't think that we should display initiative in this matter. Everyone is probably expecting this summit, because it is a step away from the prospects of a military crisis and military solution to the Korean Peninsula problem. And we dearly hope that the summit will begin the process of de-escalation.\n\nEssentially, when less than a year ago in July, Russia and China came up with the roadmap concept, that plan involved establishing a dialogue between the two Koreas and between North Korea and the United States, and to create a framework that would allow them to discuss mutual grievances and concerns.\n\nWe all want the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but it can be achieved in different ways. What we now hear about the discussions within the US administration reveals that there are many people there who want to do it quickly. I don't think that it can be done quickly though, considering what happened and what's currently going on with the Iranian nuclear program, with the agreement on it being called into question. In May, the US president must once again certify that the sanctions suspension will continue, and if he doesn't, the deal will be scrapped.\n\nSo people in Pyongyang are probably watching this development and projecting it on themselves. So while we need to pursue denuclearization, we must be realists and understand it will be a very difficult negotiation process. Because North Korea would want impervious security guarantees, especially considering Iran's example. It's hard to tell what form these guarantees would take, but it would've been an excellent solution. But like I said, first a dialogue needs to start; hopefully it will happen when the two leaders meet. Then they could move on to the very difficult work involved in discussing broader peace and security mechanisms in Northeast Asia, obviously with the help of Russia, China and Japan, just as the participants of the six-party talks agreed some time ago.\n\nBut we welcome the upcoming inter-Korean summit as well, which is scheduled to be held in April, and the upcoming North Korean-US summit, which, as President Trump said, will be held in May-June.\n\nREAD MORE: Here's the Country That May Host Long-Awaited Kim-Trump Talks\n\nSputnik: You talk about dialogue. But do you perceive yourself as old fashioned in the current situation? Trump says that he's going there not to engage in dialogue but to deliver an ultimatum. He already said that if things don't work out, he'll simply walk away. And yet you're thinking in terms of dialogue, so to speak. I understand that it's noble, but how realistic is it? I mean, he's operating with ultimatums.\n\nLavrov: We cannot wish for this meeting to fail. And I think that it's like a boxing match, when before the fighters enter the ring they weigh-in and boast, and then the fight begins. And afterwards they hug each other and congratulate each other.\n\nI don't want to use a direct analogy here, but raising the bets before a serious talk is hardly anything new in international diplomacy.

Sputnik spoke to journalist Steve Topple to find out how serious such a proposal actually is.\n\nSputnik: we\u2019re hearing more and more about the formation of an \u2018Arab coalition\u2019 to enter Syria and, according to reports, combat terrorist groups and repel \u2018Iranian influence.\u2019 Yet, considering that the architects of the plan \u2013 such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 are bogged down in Yemen, how likely is it that this will actually happen?\n\nSteve Topple: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see this come to fruition myself, personally. As you quite rightly highlight, Saudi Arabia is currently bogged down in the conflict in Yemen, and with the situation as it happened last week with the situation as it happened last week with the Syrian government retaking control of Douma I think that issue is slowly being put to bed if you like. So I think they\u2019re slightly overplaying their hand and overstating their position as it were.\n\nSputnik: Israel has reportedly binned plans to send warplanes to a joint military exercise with the US amid concerns of an impending Iranian attack. It\u2019s looking as if a showdown between Tel Aviv and Tehran in Syria could become possible \u2013 what do you see happening with this?\n\nSteve Topple: Look this has always been on the cards. I wrote over two years ago now that what we were witnessing in Syria was the first world war, if you like, of the twenty first century where you have the west and its allies standing off against Russia, Iran and its allies. I think while the situation seems to have died down as I\u2019ve previously said in terms of Assad\u2019s regime taking control of the majority of Syria, this is not over by a long shot and we saw that with the evidence of the US, French and UK airstrikes in response to the alleged chemical weapons attack and I think geopolitically this is going to continue to play out. There\u2019s still this power struggle going on for Syria if you like, for numerous reasons, as I say geopolitical, not least it\u2019s to do with oil and gas, it\u2019s to do with control its to do with the Shia and Sunni branches of Islam and it\u2019s going to run and run still. So I think if there is any offensive by Israel and the US it\u2019s quite likely this is going to play out for some time.\n\nSputnik: So do you see the US as being in Syria for the long haul now, or do you see it leaving soon as president Trump said that he wanted to before last weekend's \u2019Western airstrikes?\n\nSteve Topple: It was quite interesting actually wasn\u2019t it? Trump on the one hand saying \u2018we\u2019ve done our job\u2019 with ISIL in Syria we\u2019re going to withdraw, then suddenly the situation escalated. I think we\u2019re going to see is the continuation if you like of kind of soft power moves. I think the West has made the statement it wanted to make with the airstrikes it made on Syria last weekend and now I think it\u2019s going to be more soft power actions if you like. There\u2019s going to be a lot of propaganda a lot of foe diplomacy but I think again, like I said, it\u2019s going to continue to play out because there\u2019s too much at stake.

That\u2019s one thing, the other thing is that by the political nature of this, here we have the state technocracy investing in a private company somewhere in Virginia, $5 million, it's not a lot of money, but it is sort of an indicator to get other investors interested this. You have a state technocracy who is going to control this, what\u2019s the oversight of this, because commercial use is going to happen faster. We already have examples of the NHS in the UK piloting these apps there, might incentives from companies to have employees use and show off and you might get a bonus depending how well you take care of yourself, for example. Other concerns are how many people will have access to this data, so the app will send the data to centers, to doctors, to all sorts of personnel in the case of the military, we've seen that with the leaks and there have been so many of those, so what are the safeguards in terms of security for this data not to be taken by anybody and been sold to foreign governments, for instance. We have employees from the American military here that are going to be acting as some kind of guinea pigs, this quantification of lies, home lies, and generally how are they protected, they are also employees.

I\u2019m not sure here, it is not discussed in anything that I've read here, how this is going to happen, how the date is going to leave the app, and go where, and what is the civilian oversight here, it\u2019s very difficult to understand how they thought about this, how is the state technocracy even thinking about this, of data anonymization, transparent data collection, how do you anonymize this data.\n\nSputnik: This report comes amid a recent privacy scandal which including Facebook and the loss of data of over 90 million users, do you think this development will see further public backlash then?\n\nDr. Athina Karatzogianni: Well it\u2019s hard to tell, and the reason is we did the summary is set on computer science undergraduates, and they should be very aware of this, and it seems that people just don\u2019t care, they\u2019re thinking well if they give my data, my biometric information, or anything at all, be it on Facebook, there\u2019s pear pressure to be social, to be advertising, branding yourself, you become this product that is selling itself. In this case, people don\u2019t care if you do give your information to get better deals, or to get a bonus from your employer for taking care of yourself, for example, like giving this information for people that have diabetes or other conditions could save your life basically, so it\u2019s going to become this life or death scenario where you either give this information of your everyday life and your everyday life is continuously monitored or you're not going to live a healthy life, so this is the position we\u2019re at and it\u2019s a very strange position to be, especially, for civilians. But I would argue that American military personnel and this has happened with DARPA, and for the American military; other militaries are going to have follow suit, because this is an arms race. I think Zuckerberg put it very well, this is an arms race, and this is information war, so to speak, is an arms race and if the American military does it how, many militaries are going to follow and what is the fall out from this.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201804201063737909-trumps-syria-usa-arab-military-flaw/", "published": "2018-04-20T01:28:50", "title": "Expert Explains Why Plan to Replace US Military in Syria With Arab Troops Flawed", "text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump is seeking to replace US troops in Syria with Arab fighters. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing officials in the Trump administration, that John Bolton, his new national security adviser, has called Abbas Kamel, Egypt\u2019s acting intelligence chief. The two discussed Egypt\u2019s possible participation in Syria. This comes after Washington asked Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates for contribution to help restore northern Syria after the defeat of Daesh. According to President Trump, the administration has asked its partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing greater amounts of money.\n\nSputnik: What are your thoughts on the likelihood of Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in upholding the US proposal to contribute troops and financial assistance to Syria?\n\nDr Serkan Yolacan: Frankly, I find it quite unlikely. Saudi and Emirati forces are still actively fighting in Yemen and their entrenchment keeps training their resources. When you look at Egypt, it\u2019s consumed with, to a certain extent, an armed conflict as it struggles to cope with the Islamic State\u2019s insurgency in Sinai; and Qatar\u2019s military has limited experience and political rifts with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt would certainly prevent active military cooperation, at least between their forces.\n\nSputnik: If Trump were be able to strike a deal with any of these countries, which would be the most likely? And, once again, do you think that this would all result in a new wave of Sunni-Shiite conflict in Syria?\n\nDr Serkan Yolacan: It is possible. I think the Saudis are likely to send, Saudi Arabia has about 300,000 troops that can act on their own or dispatch troops as part of the Peninsula Shield Force, which is the military arm of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), something they did in, for example, suppressing the uprisings in Bahrain in 2011. I find it quite unlikely, but the Saudis may also put in in as part of the Islamic Military Alliance, which is a Saudi-led coalition against ISIS to contribute with some truce. But no matter which option the Saudis use, it is not clear to me that such a force would have the military capabilities or experience to act on a par with other forces on the ground, such as Iran\u2019s battle-hardened militia forces in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSputnik: Can you comment on how you see Iran\u2019s role in Syria? How long do you expect there to be an Iranian presence in Syria post the defeat of ISIS?\n\nDr Serkan Yolacan: Syria has many fronts with many actors and\u2026 Just let me go back to the initial point that I made with the political rifts among Gulf states and a lack of experience make it a very risky endeavor on their part, potentially bringing an Arab coalition up against not only Iran, but also Russia and Turkey at a time when these three powers have been playing along with one another in Syria. Rouhani, Erdogan and Putin have ongoing dialogue and the Astana process brings the three states around the same table regularly, I must say. So these actors are basically learning how to pursue different agendas without stepping on each other\u2019s toes. When we talk about Iran\u2019s influence, we need to also consider Russia as a side more and more. Such communication and coordination, that we see in the Astana process for example, is lacking in the southern tier of the Middle East, among the Arab states. I mean Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to consolidate, as we could see from his recent trip to the US. A US backed southern front against this northern tier, but we are yet to see the results of it, so I don\u2019t anticipate Iran to be pulling out of the region any time soon.\n\nSputnik: As far as the US, I mean what are the possibilities? We\u2019ve heard Trump speak about his desire to bring the US troops home and then we\u2019ve seen members of his cabinet saying absolutely the opposite, basically on the same day. But then he\u2019s repeated that he still does have a plan to withdraw from Syria. What are your thoughts on the possibilities of withdrawal and likewise the possibility of some kind of Arab forces replacing the US troops?\n\nDr Serkan Yolacan: With Trump in power it is hard to anticipate, really, but I see unlikely because of two outstanding issues: one is Israel\u2019s security, second, the Syrian Kurds. Let me elaborate very quickly: Israel is not going to trust an Arab coalition to be doing the job that the US has been doing for them. Yes, of course, for the US to defeat of ISIS may be a victory, but that means very little for Israel and its allies in the region, because basically Iran still maintains its forces in Iraq, Syria and, to certain extent,Lebanon. So I expect Israel to be to continue to lobby US to remain in Syria and that would be huge pulling effect for the US. The second issue is, of course, the future of Syrian Kurds. US patronage of Kurds against both the Syrian regime and the Turks cannot be easily replaced by an Arab coalition simply because they don\u2019t have the cachet that the US have as a global power, so patronage from an Arab coalition would mean very little for the Kurds and it\u2019s not even clear that they would accept such a patronage in the first place.

Could you please elaborate on that?\n\nRae Kwon Chung: I didn\u2019t mean to criticize the media; the point was that kind of a negative message was very well sensationalized. They are very quick to report negative messages, because people are interested about it. As I said, some person, some expert argued that investing money, spending money for climate change on the Paris Climate Agreement is a waste of money \u2013 over one, two trillion dollars every year. And he argued that kind of spending of money will reduce the EU\u2019s economic growth by 1.6 percent, while US drops 0.8 percent. Even for China, they say 0.6 percent, something like that. So that kind of message is very quickly spread out by the media \u2013 I don\u2019t blame the media \u2013 but because people are interested in that kind of negative message, but unfortunately not many positive messages are spread out, such as, as I mentioned, the tax reform, like a carbon tax can in the long run actually stimulate economic growth. There are other reports, but this kind of report is not very well spread out, because people are not very much sure about and those negative messages are very quickly spread out. That is my point. And also maybe the tactic of those people who are trying to spread the negative message, they are very quick to give this very kind of very simple message, of course. I strongly doubt that kind of argument, because it\u2019s not proven, it\u2019s only their calculation, just one calculation. But people believe it, they just believe it. So it is an unfortunate situation, but those more responsible scientist experts they don\u2019t spread out that kind of numbers so quickly, because we never know what will happen in the long run, in 20 years\u2019 time. But some scientists and economists that are spreading out so quickly without taking much responsibility, but some people take it very seriously and they don\u2019t spread out positive messages. So there\u2019s an imbalance of negative messages that are well spread out, while positive messages are not very well spread out, so there\u2019s an imbalance.\n\nSputnik: Do you think it has an impact on the politicians\u2019 decisions and the way politics goes?\n\nRae Kwon Chung: Sure. Like Mr. Trump. He believes that carbon climate action is going to damage the American economy. That is based on that kind of study; many economists are coming up with those kinds of predictions. He\u2019s not the only one; there are many who are saying that if we increase investment for renewable energy it will reduce the economic growth.

The video, which gained some 75,000 views, has since been removed from Aquino's page.\n\nIn the video, seconds after Aquino is told to place her purse on the driver's seat and step out of the car, things take a turn for the worse.\n\n\"No, I'm going to hold my phone,\" Aquino tells the officer, who's already starting to lose his temper. \"I am going to hold my phone because I have my rights.

I do not care. I do not want you to have that phone in your hand\u2026 I do not want you to use it as a weapon,\" the unidentified officer tells Aquino.\n\nWith Aquino repeatedly refusing to hand over the phone and attempting to exit the car, the officer doubles down and stresses that he \"is in control\" and that he \"will tell [her] when to get out of the car.\"\n\n\"If you do not put that phone down, I will take it out of your hands,\" he said. Three seconds later, he reached for the phone but failed to get hold of it. The officer then opens the car door and tries to reach for the phone by climbing over Aquino. This did not work, either.\n\nThe officer later obtained the phone after his partner came over and offered a helping hand. Aquino and her husband, Chris Moreno, who was driving the car, were put into handcuffs while officers searched the car. They were later released and only cited for having an open container that had marijuana residue.\n\nThis altercation took place on April 12 at roughly 10 a.m. local time.\n\nAccording to a statement released Wednesday by the police department, responding officers decided to search the car after they realized that the driver was a convicted arsonist and was on parole.\n\n\"The officer requested the female and male to exit the vehicle.

Opening access to American weapons and drones helps \"reduce\" other countries' \"reliance, not just on Chinese knockoffs, but also on Russian systems,\" White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday.\n\nThe new policy effectively recategorizes certain drones to make it easier for the government to approve their sale.\n\nSpecifically, the US moved to allow drone systems sales under what are called direct commercial sale (DCS) agreements. Unlike a foreign military sale (FMS) agreement, which used to govern most drone sales, in a DCS agreement, the US government mostly sits on the sidelines while contracts are negotiated between the contractor and the non-US purchaser. DCS deals are seen as quicker and potentially cheaper as a result of lower administrative hurdles.\n\nNavarro told reporters Thursday that, \"although the US leads the way in UAS technology, overly restricted policies enacted by the previous administration\" made exporting drones abroad a hassle. The US government's preferred term for a drone is an \"unmanned aerial system,\" or UAS.\n\nThe other protocol that was changed on Thursday was the policy that stated that a UAS with laser designating technology \u2014 which can be used to paint lasers onto targets for missiles fired from other platforms \u2014 was \"strike enabling.\"\n\n\"We'll be reducing the complications to how we classify UAS,\" Kaidanow explained.\n\n\"Because under the previous policy, UAS equipped with so-called \u2018strike-enabling technology,' like laser target designators, were classified under a specific, discrete category. And the criteria for transferring that category of UAS was equivalent to the criteria for transferring an armed UAS. So we placed the proposed transfer of UASs equipped with strike-enabling technologies under significant scrutiny in the past and we limited their transfer to occur only through the foreign military sale system,\" she said. That will no longer be the case.\n\nThe laser designator issue is \"one of the things that has hampered the sale of these particular systems,\" Kaidanow said, without specifying what drone systems she had in mind.\n\nAs Defense News reports, however, the regulations don't go very far. Selling a \"category-1\" drone that carries a 500-kilogram payload over a distance greater than 300 kilometers is still very rare. The new policy hasn't changed that.\n\nUnder the Obama-era policy, only Britain, France and Italy were approved to buy armed drones like Predators and Reapers, according to Dan Gettinger of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College.\n\nWhile the changes align with US President Donald Trump's calls to make it easier to sell other countries US military products, the new policy doesn't actually change the law or regulatory environment per se.\n\n\"Okay. So let me be very clear. Nothing in the \u2014 this new NSPM [national security presidential memorandum] that will be issued changes either the existing legal or the regulatory requirements. And we are very respectful of Congress's role in all of this\u2026 Every sale we do is on a case-by-case basis,\" Kaidanow stressed."}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/radio_by_any_means/201804201063735184-the-future-of-ne-asia/", "published": "2018-04-19T21:18:00", "title": "The Future of NE Asia; Gentrification Lawsuit Filed Against DC", "text": "The Future of NE Asia; Gentrification Lawsuit Filed Against DC\n\nDoes Pompeo get credit for Peace Process in Korea?; The new farm bill creates crisis for American farmers; Abe and Trump meet.\n\nOn this episode of \"By Any Means Necessary\" Eugene Puryear and Sean Blackmon are joined by Reece Chenault, National Coordinator for US Labor Against the War, to talk about Mike Pompeo's visit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and the credit South and North Korea's deserve for their commitment to a peace process.\n\nIn a special second segment Jim Goodman, Board President of the National Family Farm Coalition and an organic dairy and beef farmer from Wisconsin joins the show to look at the crisis US farmers are facing, the way global food exchange is destroying local farming, and the need for focus on rural development and broadband internet connection.\n\nIn the third segment \"By Any Means Necessary\" is joined by Dr. Vijay Prashad, Executive Director of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, to talk about Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meeting with Donald Trump, how Japan may fare in nuclear talks between the Koreas and the US, and how the meeting may impact Abe's stature back in Japan.\n\nLater in the show Ari Theresa, gentrification attorney at Stoop Law and Sputnik News Analyst Bob Schlehuber join the show to talk about the ongoing racism at Starbucks, a new gentrification lawsuit filed against the city of Washington, D.C., unethical journalism by Atlanta's NPR station WABE, and \u2018Black Panther' star Chadwick Boseman speaking at Howard's commencement.\n\nWe'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com"}, {"link": "https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201804201063735075-israel-independence-day/", "published": "2018-04-19T21:14:00", "title": "Seventy Years on, Israel Should Feel Mostly Optimistic About Its Future - Expert", "text": "This week Israelis celebrated their country's 70th birthday.

Israel is recognized in the world as a very strong country militarily, economically as well as in science. Therefore, Israel has now good foreign relations with most of the countries [across] the world: the main powers [of] the US and Russia, China and India; with Australia, Europe, Africa, Latin America; Arab countries [such] as Egypt and Jordan; and even has non-formal relations with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Israeli economy is now one of strongest economies in the world. And finally, although Israel is quite a small country, it is recognized as a high-tech and cyber global power.\n\nREAD MORE: What's That?

Economically and politically, Israel has to face with the BDS [Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions] movement around the world together with its anti-semitic characters in Europe, and somehow negative relations to Israel in the European Union.\n\nSputnik: One of the threats regularly identified by Israel is Iran. In your opinion, how serious is the threat from Tehran?\n\nRaphael Ofek: The Iranian threat on Israel is in two dimensions: Tehran may break out from the 2015 nuclear deal renewing [its] military nuclear program. Tehran is striving to build a second battle front against Israel in Syria by constructing military bases on Syrian territory and to have a land corridor in Syria and to [its] proxy in Lebanon, the Hezbollah.\n\nREAD MORE: Once US Takes Over Syria, Turkey and Iran's Turn Would Come \u2014 Politician\n\nSputnik: Do you think there's any chance that relations between Israel and Iran will change? What measures have to be taken for these changes to occur?\n\nRaphael Ofek: Opposite to the very good relations between the two countries during the Shah era, before [the] Khomeini revolution in 1979, the present Tehran's clerical ayatollahs' regime is very hostile towards Israel, considering [it] as Satan, and tries to annihilate [it] from the Middle East map. The only change may occur if the present Iranian regime [is] changed. The Iranian nation is fed up [with] the present regime.\n\nSputnik: In your view, how is it that Israel manages to maintain stable relations with the both the US and Russia, despite both countries having a very different stance on the Syrian conflict?\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Oded Balilty Eternal Light: How Israelis Celebrate 70 Years of Independence (PHOTO, VIDEO)\n\nAlthough interests in Syria are not identical to the Israeli attitude, Russia is interested [in preventing] the continuation [of] the military clashes in Syria, in order to avoid any damage to [its] bases in Syria, the Tartus naval port and the Khmeimim airport. Therefore, [Russia] prefers a modus vivendi/modus operandi with Israel. Russia is worried about the Iranian advancement in Syria. Personally, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has some sympathy, a certain respect to Israel. Many Israeli citizens emigrated from Russia, since the beginning of the 20th century and until now.\n\nSputnik: US President Donald Trump recently recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Korea, setting stage for talks, halts nuclear, ICBM tests", "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea announced Saturday it will suspend nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches ahead of its summits with Seoul and Washington, but stopped well short of suggesting it has any intention of giving up its nuclear weapons or scale back its production of missiles and their related component parts.\n\nThe new policy, which sets the table for further negotiations when the summits begin, was announced by leader Kim Jong Un at a meeting of the North Korean ruling party's Central Committee on Friday and reported by the North's state-run media early Saturday.\n\nKim justified the suspension to his party by saying that the situation around North Korea has been rapidly changing \"in favor of the Korean revolution\" since he announced last year his country had completed its nuclear forces. He said North Korea has reached the level where it no longer needs to conduct underground testing or test-launching of ICBMs.\n\nHe added that the country would close its nuclear testing facility at Punggye-ri, though that site was already believed to have been rendered largely unusable due to tunnel collapses after the North's test of what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb last year.\n\nThe announcement is seen as an opening gambit aimed at setting the tone for talks ahead of Kim's summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in next Friday and U.S. President Donald Trump in late May or early June.\n\nTrump almost immediately responded with a tweet saying, \"This is very good news for North Korea and the World\" and \"big progress!\" He added that he's looking forward to his upcoming summit with Kim.\n\nSouth Korea's presidential office also welcomed North Korea's announcement as \"meaningful progress\" toward the denuclearization of the peninsula. Presidential official Yoon Young-chan said in a statement that the North's decision brightens the prospects for successful talks between Seoul, Pyongyang and Washington.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the announcement too but was a bit more guarded in his reaction.\n\n\"What is crucial here ... is how this development is going to lead to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of nuclear arms, weapons of mass destruction and missiles,\" he said. \"And I will keep a close eye on that.\"\n\nSome analysts believe that rather than denuclearizing, Kim feels he is entering the negotiations from a position of strength and is hoping to achieve tacit recognition that his country is now a nuclear power. They believe he wants engage in talks and make some concessions around the edges that would convince Washington and other countries to ease sanctions on his struggling economy.\n\nIn his speech at the party meeting, Kim praised his nuclear policy as \"a miraculous victory\" achieved in just five years. A resolution passed after his speech also stressed that the country had successfully achieved its goals of obtaining a viable nuclear force and suggested it intends to keep that force - at least for the time being.\n\nUsing the acronym for North Korea's official name, it said the North would \"never use nuclear weapons nor transfer nuclear weapons or nuclear technology under any circumstances unless there are nuclear threat and nuclear provocation against the DPRK.\"\n\n\"This was a smart move by Kim,\" said Vipin Narang, an associate political science professor and nuclear proliferation expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"Although it largely formalizes previous pledges on the moratoria from last November and March, it still leaves a lot of wiggle room for circumventing the pledges in the future, and nothing in there is irreversible. And nothing in there mentions denuclearization, of any variety.\"\n\nNarang noted that North Korea has already conducted as many nuclear tests as Pakistan and India, and may indeed not need to conduct any more underground testing.\n\n\"The aim of this, in my view, is to make it exceedingly difficult for Trump to say the North is uninterested in talks and walk away,\" he said. \"Kim is doing everything he can now - in a reversible way, mind you - to ensure the summit happens. Because that's his ultimate victory.\"\n\nTossing out another nugget that could be used at the summits, Kim stressed at the party meeting his desire to shift the national focus to improving the country's economy, which has been hit hard by international sanctions and the \"maximum pressure\" strategy pushed by Trump.\n\nThe announcement ends what had been an ominous silence from Pyongyang regarding the stunning diplomatic moves Kim has been making since the beginning of this year, including his first summit, with Chinese President Xi Jinping, last month.\n\nIt also gives the best idea yet of what Kim intends to bring with him in his summits with Moon and Trump.\n\nSeoul says Kim has expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \"denuclearization\" that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops from the peninsula.\n\nSome important items were also left off the North's resolution, suggesting either that the North isn't willing to go that far or that it wants to wait and see how much it can gain by further concessions once actual talks begin.\n\nIt did not announce a moratorium on short- or mid-range missile launches or ground-based engine testing. It also did not suspend the production of more fissile material to build additional warheads, or the production of the longer-range missiles, which are Washington's primary concern.\n\nAt the height of Pyongyang's standoff with Washington and Seoul last year, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters the country could conduct an atmospheric hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThat kind of test would also not be included in the suspension.\n\n---\n\nTalmadge, the AP's Pyongyang bureau chief, reported from Tokyo."}, {"link": "http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SCHOOL_SHOOTING_STUDENT_PROTESTS_TXOL-?SITE=WHIZ&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT", "published": null, "title": "In new walkouts, students look to turn outrage to action", "text": "Once again, they filed out of class. In a new wave of school walkouts, they raised their voices against gun violence. But this time, they were looking to turn outrage into action.\n\nMany of the students who joined demonstrations across the country Friday turned their attention to upcoming elections as they pressed for tougher gun laws and politicians who will enact them. Scores of rallies turned into voter registration drives. Students took the stage to issue an ultimatum to their lawmakers.\n\n\"We want to show that we're not scared. We want to stop mass shootings and we want gun control,\" said Binayak Pandey, 16, who rallied with dozens of students outside Georgia's Capitol in Atlanta. \"The people who can give us that will stay in office, and the people who can't give us that will be out of office.\"\n\nAll told, tens of thousands of students left class Friday for protests that spread from coast to coast. They filed out at 10 a.m. to gather for a moment of silence honoring the victims of gun violence. Some headed to nearby rallies. Others stayed at school to discuss gun control and register their peers to vote.\n\nOrganizers said an estimated 150,000 students protested Friday at more than 2,700 walkouts, including at least one in each state, as they sought to sustain a wave of youth activism that drove a larger round of walkouts on March 14. Activists behind that earlier protest estimated it drew nearly 1 million students.\n\nHeadCount, a nonprofit group that registers voters at music events, said 700 people had signed up to vote through its website during the past week. That's up from just 10 people in the same period last year. Spokesman Aaron Ghitelman credited the uptick to walkout organizers who steered teens to the group's website.\n\nFriday's action was planned by a Connecticut teenager, Lane Murdock, after a gunman stormed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14, leaving 17 people dead. It was meant to coincide with the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colorado.\n\nThe focus on the November elections reflects a shift after activists gained little immediate traction in Washington - and prospects for their influence remain uncertain. Congress has shown little inclination to tighten gun laws, and President Donald Trump backed away from his initial support for raising the minimum age to buy some guns.\n\nAmong those who helped orchestrate the walkout - and the voter registration push - was the progressive group Indivisible, which formed after the 2016 election to oppose Trump's policies.\n\nIn cities across the country, it was common to see crowds of students clad in orange - the color used by hunters to signal \"don't shoot\" - rallying outside their schools or at public parks.\n\nSeveral hundred gathered at New York City's Washington Square Park, chanting \"The NRA has got to go!\" and \"Enough is enough.\" A large group in Washington marched from the White House to the Capitol building to rally for gun control.\n\nNate Fenerty was among dozens of students who left class to rally in Richmond, Virginia. He registered to vote for the first time at tables set up by students at the protest and said he wants Congress to approve mandatory background checks for gun buyers.\n\n\"How many more times are we going to stand in memoriam for another school shooting before our policymakers to actually do something?\" said Fenerty, who carried a sign saying \"Am I Next?\"\n\nVirginia students had expected 10,000 people at the Richmond rally, but only about 300 showed up. Still, those who turned up said they weren't discouraged.\n\nShortly before the walkouts, news spread that there had been another shooting at a Florida school. Authorities say one student shot another in the ankle at Forest High School in Ocala early Friday. A suspect was taken into custody. Activists said it underscored the urgency of their work.\n\nStudent David Hogg, a Parkland survivor who has emerged as a leading activist, took to social media nearly every day this week urging students to register. On Thursday he made the motivation clear on Twitter: \"The only way to make politicians listen to us is by voting in ones that will,\" he said.\n\nHogg was among about 50 students who walked out of Stoneman Douglas on Friday after administrators threatened protesters with unexcused absences.\n\nCraig Smith and Terry McGary, both 17-year-old juniors, said they walked out because they want to show respect for the Columbine victims.\n\n\"It was a guilt trip to make us not walk out,\" McGary said about the threat.\n\nThe walkouts drew counter-protesters in some areas, including about 30 at a rally outside New Hampshire's statehouse. In Kansas, about 200 gun-rights supporters held their own demonstration outside the statehouse. Many carried signs and flags, and some brought holstered handguns.\n\nKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican candidate for governor, addressed the crowd and later criticized the walkout movement.\n\n\"Instead of walking out of class, why don't you stay in class and spend that half hour studying the Second Amendment?

Some of the activists threw stones toward the fence or flew kites with flaming rags dangling from their tails.\n\nThe latest deaths brought to 32 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in protests since late March. More than 1,600 have been wounded by live rounds in the past three weeks, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe rising Palestinian casualty toll signaled that Israel's military is sticking to its open-fire rules despite international criticism of the use of lethal force against unarmed protesters.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced from homes in the 1948 war over Israel's creation. Palestinians mark May 15, the anniversary of Israel's founding, as their \"nakba,\" or catastrophe, to mourn their mass uprooting.\n\n\"We will stay here until we reclaim our lands,\" said Ahmed Nasman, 21, speaking in a protest tent camp east of Gaza City, as activists near him prepared kites. \"Every day, we will come here with a new way to resist them,\" he said, referring to Israel.\n\nSeveral thousand protesters flocked to the border area Friday, most gathering at five tent camps several hundred meters (yards) away from the border. Smaller groups advanced toward the fence, throwing stones, burning tires and flying kites with burning rags.\n\nThe kites are part of a new tactic aimed at setting fields on the Israeli side on fire. Most kites showed the colors of the Palestinian flag. One white kite bore a Nazi swastika.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Israeli military aircraft had dropped leaflets urging Palestinians to stay away from the fence and warning that they endanger their lives if they follow Hamas directives.\n\nWhile Hamas and smaller Palestinian factions have taken a lead as organizers, the mass marches are also fueled by growing desperation among Gaza's 2 million residents.\n\nThe border blockade has trapped nearly all of them in the tiny coastal territory, gutted the economy and deepened poverty. Gaza residents typically get fewer than five hours of electricity per day, while unemployment has soared above 40 percent.\n\nYehiyeh Sinwar, a top Hamas official, told activists that even if conditions are tough, \"we will not bargain on the Palestinian people's rights in exchange for bread.\"\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of cynically exploiting Gaza civilians for its political aims. Hamas critics say the group's refusal to disarm has been a key obstacle to ending the blockade.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry said those killed Friday included three men in their 20s and a 15-year-old boy.\n\nIn addition, 729 protesters were hurt, including 156 hit by live fire, the ministry said, adding that five of the wounded were in serious condition. Some of the others were hurt by rubber-coated steel pellets or overcome by tear gas.\n\nThe military has said Palestinians have tried to damage the border fence with explosives, firebombs and other means. It has said snipers only target the \"main instigators.\"\n\nRights groups have branded open-fire orders as unlawful, saying they effectively permit soldiers to use potentially lethal force against unarmed protesters.\n\n---\n\nLaub reported from Jericho, West Bank.

Greitens' campaign paid a fine and reported the list as a $600 contribution from a former campaign worker, leaving unexplained how the campaign worker obtained the list.\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in late February that a Greitens Group employee who also previously worked for the charity emailed the list \u2014 created in 2014 \u2014 to two Greitens campaign workers in January 2015.\n\nThe charity has denied giving donor information to Greitens.

(Photo: Larry Busacca, Getty Images for Coachella)\n\nKendrick Lamar's Pulitzer Prize triumph this week was greeted by widespread celebration in the hip-hop and mainstream music worlds \u2014 and no small amount of grumbling from more traditional quarters.\n\nThe L.A. rapper made history Monday when his album Damn captured the Pulitzer music prize, awarded since 1943 to honor \"distinguished musical composition by an American.\"\n\nFor both fans and detractors, it was a stunning win. For decades, the music Pulitzer had gone strictly to classical composers, with three recent jazz exceptions: Wynton Marsalis in 1997, Ornette Coleman in 2007 and Henry Threadgill in 2016. Lamar wasn't merely the first winner from the hip-hop sphere \u2014 he was the first from the popular-music universe, period.\n\nMore: Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer Prize and fans are here for it\n\nBut Lamar's selection was merited and meaningful, said Regina Carter, chair of the Pulitzer's five-member music jury.\n\nSpeaking with the Detroit Free Press, the Detroit-born violinist championed Lamar and his album \u2014 one of the three unanimously selected finalists presented by the jury to the Pulitzer Board for a final decision.\n\n\"It's part of the American art form. We felt that his delivery of the work, his writing, was really powerful in the messages he had,\" Carter said. \"You have to really sit with them, and they have heavier meaning than when you hear them the first time.\"\n\nDamn, Lamar's fourth album, is a musically minimalist work rich with storytelling and commentary that tackles a wide sweep of subjects: police brutality, the financial system, inner angst, family struggles.\n\n\"It's his history; it's our history,\" said Carter. \"And no matter what side of the aisle you're on politically, with all the ugliness going on in the world, it speaks to that in a really creative way.\"\n\nPushback has largely come from classical musicians and enthusiasts, largely on social media and web forums. Much of it has been collected and presented \u2014 albeit with anonymity \u2014 at the Twitter feed NewMusicDrama, which held a vote Friday for \"Ultimate Bad Pulitzer Take.\"\n\n\"My outrage at a rapper winning the thing has NOTHING to do with 'race' (his or mine), but everything to do with culture,\" read one post. \"Rap music is GARBAGE, and a purveyor of it winning the Pulitzer is the ultimate in philistinism.\"\n\nWrote a less incendiary online critic: \"The Pulitzer Prize now has no meaning in classical music. It's over.\"\n\n\"For some, it's still unthinkable,\" Carter told the Free Press. \"But (the jury's selection) was not that it was a hip-hop project. It's that it was Kendrick Lamar and what he delivered.\"\n\nOther skeptics have questioned the Pulitzer decision not because of a distaste for Lamar or hip-hop, per se. Perhaps understandably, they're worried it signals the erosion of one of the few remaining high-profile platforms for recognizing classical music.\n\nThen again, this is an award that has been charged with debate through its lifetime. Even within the classical realm, the Pulitzers were long criticized for emphasizing the work of abstract, challenging high-modernist artists at the expense of others. And it wasn't until 1996 that a black composer \u2014 George Walker \u2014 won the prize at all.\n\nCarter, who made her name with the Detroit outfit Straight Ahead in the '80s and went on to a celebrated New York jazz career, said Lamar's Pulitzer may help right some misconceptions about the art of hip-hop.\n\n\"Some people will argue that (traditional) composers spend years writing their scores, writing their pieces, but they think, 'Well, here's a hip-hop artist who's just going in off-the-cuff,\" she said. \"That's not true. If anybody reads about (Lamar), he spends years on his craft.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2HOkAz1"}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/540660672/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Michael-J-Fox-recovering-from-spinal-surgery-aposunrelatedapos-to-Parkinsonaposs/", "published": "2018-04-21T01:45:01", "title": "Michael J.

I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation. I treasure my Israeli friends and family, Israeli food, books, art, cinema, and dance.'\"\n\nShe asked people to \"not take any words that do not come directly from me as my own.\"\n\nIsrael faces some international criticism over its use of lethal force in response to mass protests along the Gaza border led by the Islamic militant group that rules the territory.\n\nOne Israeli lawmaker warned that Portman's decision is a sign of eroding support for Israel among young American Jews.\n\nThe Jerusalem-born Portman is a dual Israeli-American citizen. The Oscar-winning actress moved to the United States as a young girl, evolving from a child actress into a widely acclaimed A-list star. Portman received the 2011 best actress Academy Award for Black Swan, and, in 2015, she directed and starred in Tale of Love and Darkness, a Hebrew-language film set in Israel based on an Amos Oz novel. Her success is a great source of pride for many Israelis.\n\nThe Genesis Prize Foundation said Thursday that it had been informed by Portman's representative that \"recent events in Israel have been extremely distressing\" to Portman, though it did not refer to specific events.\n\nSince March 30, more than three dozen Palestinians have been killed by Israeli army fire, most of them in protests on the Gaza-Israeli border. Hundreds more have been wounded by Israeli troops during this time.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border and accuses Hamas, a militant group sworn to Israel's destruction, of trying to carry out attacks under the guise of protests. It has said that some of those protesting at the border over the past few weeks tried to damage the fence, plant explosives and hurl firebombs, or flown kites attached to burning rags to set Israeli fields on fire. Several Israeli communities are located near the Gaza border.\n\nRights groups have branded open-fire rules as unlawful, saying they effectively permit soldiers to use potentially lethal force against unarmed protesters.\n\nIsrael's right-wing Culture Minister Miri Regev said in a statement Friday that she was sorry to hear that Portman \"has fallen like a ripe fruit into the hands of BDS supporters,\" referring to the Palestinian-led boycott movement.\n\n\"Natalie, a Jewish actress born in Israel, is joining those who relate to the wondrous success story of Israel's rebirth as a story of 'darkness and darkness',\" Regev said.\n\nRachel Azaria, a lawmaker from the centrist Kulanu party, warned that Portman's decision to stay away is a sign of eroding support for Israel among young American Jews.\n\n\"The cancellation by Natalie Portman needs to light warning signs,\" Azaria said in a statement. \"She is totally one of us. She identifies with her Jewishness and Israeli-ness. She is expressing now the voices of many in U.S. Jewry, mainly those of the young generation. This is a community that was always a significant anchor for the state of Israel. The price of losing them could be too high.\"\n\nOren Hazan, a legislator in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party, called on the government to revoke Portman's Israeli citizenship.\n\nGilad Erdan, Israel's Public Security Minister said he sent a letter to Portman expressing his disappointment. \"Sadly, it seems that you have been influenced by the campaign of media misinformation and lies regarding Gaza orchestrated by the Hamas terrorist group,\" he wrote.\n\nHe invited her to visit and see for herself the situation on the ground.\n\nThe Genesis foundation said it was \"very saddened\" by Portman's decision and would cancel the prize ceremony, which had been set for June 28.\n\n\"We fear that Ms. Portman's decision will cause our philanthropic initiative to be politicized, something we have worked hard for the past five years to avoid,\" it said.\n\nPortman said in her statement that the backlash has inspired her to make numerous contributions to charities in Israel. She pledged to announce those grants soon.\n\nThe Genesis Prize was launched in 2013 to recognize Jewish achievement and contributions to humanity. Previous recipients include former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, actor Michael Douglas, violinist Itzhak Perlman and sculptor Anish Kapoor.\n\nWhen Portman was announced late last year as the 2018 recipient, she said in a statement released by organizers at the time that she was \"proud of my Israeli roots and Jewish heritage.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2JbpFRi"}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/540627182/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Princeaposs-death-His-laptop-diet-weight-loss-and-distress-highlight-intriguing-police-docs/", "published": "2018-04-20T23:48:21", "title": "Prince's death: His laptop, diet, weight loss and distress highlight intriguing police docs", "text": "CLOSE After a nearly two-year long investigation, questions still remain regarding the death of Prince.

There are audio files on the recording of various statements.\n\nHere are some of the intriguing details we've found so far:\n\nThe death scene:\n\nThere are five videos containing close-ups of Prince's dead body, sprawled on his back on a Persian-style rug at the entrance to the elevator at Paisley Park.\n\nHe was slightly on his left side, his left arm on the floor, his right arm across his midsection. His left arm and right ankle had EKG cable patches from lifesaving techniques used by paramedics. His right wrist was wrapped in blue tape. He was shoeless, dressed in black and grey workout-style clothes with black socks, and a black knit cap covered his head and hair.\n\nPrince's laptop:\n\nA report by Sgt. DeWitt Meier described what he saw and did when he arrived to help with the investigation of the scene on the day Prince's body was found. On April 21, 2016, Meier saw an Apple laptop sitting on the dresser in Prince's bedroom, but he didn't search it or seize it. He saw no cellphones.\n\nThe next day, Meier says, after numerous pill bottles were found throughout Paisley Park, he learned that Prince and his staff communicated by telephone or email only, not cellphone.\n\n\"I regretted not taking the computer by the bedside, as I believe that this contained conversations between his staff and (Prince) about medications possibly,\" Meier wrote.\n\nOnly then did he direct someone to get a search warrant for the laptop, which by then had been placed in a locked office. When the search warrant was finally executed five days after Prince's death, a locksmith had to be called to open the door and retrieve it.\n\nPrince performs at Sziget (Island) Festival on August 9, 2011 in Budapest. (Photo: STR, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPrince did not have or use a cellphone, authorities said, and that was one of the reasons it was difficult to find evidence to show how he obtained counterfeit Vicodin laced with fentanyl. If there was any such evidence on Prince's laptop it might have been tampered with before it was finally seized.\n\nPrince's half-sister, Sharon Nelson, tweeted her dismay about how the laptop was handled.\n\n\"There is so much about Prince\u2019s death and this investigation that troubles me and millions of #Prince fans around the world,\" she tweeted Friday.\n\nThere is so much about Prince\u2019s death and this investigation that troubles me and millions of #Prince fans around the world. It\u2019s even worst than Comerica Bank\u2019s work. He died, no collecting his computer, securing building, files, records, etc? \u2014 Sharon L. Nelson (@Sharon_L_Nelson) April 20, 2018\n\nInterview with Kirk Johnson:\n\nHe was Prince's friend from the 1980s, a sometime drummer for him, best man at his first wedding, bodyguard and estate manager. But he told investigators even he did not always know what was going on with Prince.\n\n\"He's really, he's always been private so I mean even from me he would keep me at a\n\ndistance so you know, I respected that, respected his privacy,\" he said in his interview with Det. Chris Wagner.\n\nNot until just before his death did Johnson realize how ill Prince was. \"He had been looking just a little frail, but I just, you know...he just always kind of goes up and down,\" he said.\n\nThen, on the way home from an Atlanta gig a week before his death, Prince became unconscious on his private plane, Johnson said. The plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Ill., Prince was given doses of the drug used to treat a narcotics overdose and he was rushed to a local hospital where he was treated and released.\n\nWas Prince addicted to painkillers, Johnson was asked.\n\n\"He never told me that but that's what I'm finding out,\" Johnson said. \"I mean and l just figured that out after that time we had to land the plane that this is what...it started to all make sense through just his behavior sometimes and change of mood...That's why I took the initiative and said let's go to my doctor because you haven't been to the doctor, let's check it all out.\"\n\nThe day before his death, Johnson took Prince to his longtime local doctor, Michael Todd Schulenberg, who also was interviewed by investigators. On that day, Schulenberg saw Prince and ran some tests and prescribed other medications to help him. A urinalysis came back positive for opioids.\n\nSchulenberg prescribed the opioid painkiller oxycodone to Prince on April 14, 2016, but put it under the name of Johnson. Two years later, on Thursday, Schulenberg agreed to pay $30,000 to settle a federal civil claim for knowingly writing a prescription in someone else's name, which violates the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nInterviews with Meron Berkure, Prince's personal assistant:\n\nThe transcripts of her interviews show she was reluctant to talk to investigators, saying repeatedly that she and all of Prince's staff had signed \"confidentiality agreements\" as a condition of employment. At one point, she said she wanted a lawyer.\n\n\"As his personal assistant and knowing (he's) private, I would like to keep his privacy,\" she told Det. Pat Murray.\n\nCarver County Attorney Mark Metz, right, and flanked by Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud and Sheriff Jim Olson, April 19, 2018. (Photo: Glen Stubbe, AP)\n\nMurray tried to reassure her she was not in trouble, that investigators were trying to find out more about how Prince had ended up dead. He said investigators already gathered information that Prince was struggling with chemical dependency, and as his personal assistant did she notice if he seemed normal or \"out of it\" the day before his death?\n\nBerkure didn't know, only saw him from a \"far distance.\" She said he went to the doctor the day before for a \"checkup.\" In another interview with another detective and Sheriff Jim Olson, she said Prince had been unusually quiet.\n\n\"He usually emails us and like throughout the day but because he wasn't feeling well, you know...\" she said.\n\nShe said he had the \"flu\" and canceled a performance. But she said she didn't see any symptoms of the flu. \"Unless he shared it with the doctor. He didn't share it with me,\" she said.\n\nShe also had about $3,000 in cash in her purse, which was searched. She said, \"I do a lot of like tour book sales and stuff like that.\"\n\nInterview with Ray Roberts\n\nPrince's personal chef since 2013, Roberts also owns a local restaurant, Peoples Organic, and provided Prince, a vegan, with a daily dinner of appetizer, entre and dessert, and stocked his fridge. The night before Prince's death, Roberts arrived with a meal: roasted pepper bisque, a salad and a smoothie. Roberts thought Prince didn't look good, which usually meant he wanted his privacy.\n\n\"Roberts stated that night Prince didn't seem good. Roberts stated Prince looked distressed. Roberts stated Prince looked like he wasn't feeling good,\" the transcript reads.\n\n(In fact, the dinner didn't get eaten; Roberts said it was still in his refrigerator during Prince's memorial lunch later.)\n\nRoberts said Prince's behavior was \"up and down\" and that the people around him talked about his health \"a lot.\" Roberts noticed weight loss.\n\n\"Roberts stated he had noticed over the last month Prince had been losing weight. Roberts stated he felt like Prince was eating less and wasn't drinking any water,\" the transcript says.\n\nRoberts told investigators that Prince would be \"happy and energetic and then he would be sleeping or not feeling well,\" the transcript says. \"Roberts stated Prince's health issue was related to stress from his work.\"\n\nRoberts said his job was to make sure Prince was \"eating right and drinking enough fluids.\" When Prince would report ailments (such as a sore throat) to Roberts, Roberts would prepare food accordingly.\n\n.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2JcC47s"}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/540614024/0/usatoday-newstopstories~aposSmallvilleapos-actress-Allison-Mack-charged-with-sex-trafficking-for-role-in-NXIVM-cult/", "published": "2018-04-20T21:55:16", "title": "'Smallville' actress Allison Mack charged with sex trafficking for role in NXIVM cult", "text": "CLOSE Sarah Edmondson, a Canadian actress, says she was branded as part of an initiation into a secret sorority.

Bauer affirmed a district court ruling striking down the law on Thursday.\n\n\"The non-discrimination provisions clearly violate well-established Supreme Court precedent holding that a woman may terminate her pregnancy prior to viability, and that the State may not prohibit a woman from exercising that right for any reason,\" he wrote.\n\nShortly after the bill was signed, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky (PPINK), represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, filed a complaint in the Southern District of Indiana seeking an injunction from the non-discrimination and fetal disposition provisions.\n\nMore on Pence: Trump is the 'most pro-life president in American history,' Pence says\n\nRead more: Human Rights Campaign call Vice President Pence 'one of the greatest threats to equality'\n\nThe non-discrimination provisions prohibit abortions based solely on race, sex or diagnosis or a potential diagnosis of a disability such as Down syndrome, while the disposition provision dictated how a provider must dispose of the aborted fetus.\n\nPPINK argued that the disposition provision would render it unable to contract with third-party cremation providers and would require providers to bury, cremate or entomb the fetuses.\n\nWhen U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Walton Pratt issued a preliminary injunction in June 2016, she said the law would likely be found unconstitutional and that it violated U.S. Supreme Court precedents that protect a woman's right to choose an abortion before a fetus is viable and the right to privacy in making that decision.\n\nShe issued a permanent injunction against the measure in September. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill appealed.\n\n\"By declaring unconstitutional a state law that would bar abortions based solely on race, sex or disability such as Down syndrome, a federal judge has cleared the path for genetic discrimination that once seemed like science fiction,\" Hill said in a September statement to IndyStar. \"This state has a compelling interest in protecting the dignity of the unborn and in ensuring they are not selected for termination simply because they lack preferred physical characteristics.\"\n\nAbortion laws: Judge blocks Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban from going into effect\n\nRead more: At anti-abortion rally, Mike Pence is a beacon of hope\n\nWhen contacted Friday, a spokesperson for Hill's office declined to comment further.\n\nIn his Thursday opinion, Bauer wrote that the provisions represented a barrier in a woman's right to choose.\n\n\"The provisions prohibit abortions prior to viability if the abortion is sought for a particular purpose,\" Bauer wrote. \"These provisions are far greater than a substantial obstacle; they are absolute prohibitions on abortions prior to viability which the Supreme Court has clearly held cannot be imposed by the State.\"\n\nBauer further wrote that the \"binary choice\" theory established by 1992's Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey \u2014 in which a woman may terminate her pregnancy only if she decided she did not want a child before becoming pregnant \u2014 is contrary to the idea that a woman's right to choose is rooted in her Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy.\n\n\"It is entirely inconsistent to hold that a woman\u2019s right of privacy to terminate a pregnancy exists if a woman decides before she becomes pregnant that she does not want to bear a child, but that the State can eliminate this privacy right if a woman later decides she wants to terminate her pregnancy for a particular purpose,\" he wrote. \"Nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment or Supreme Court precedent allows the State to invade this privacy realm to examine the underlying basis for a woman\u2019s decision to terminate her pregnancy prior to viability.\"\n\nJane Henegar, executive director of the ACLU of Indiana, said in a written statement that Thursday's decision \"affirmed a woman's fundamental right to make her own personal medical decisions.\"\n\n\"This ruling is a victory for women and another repudiation of attempts by Indiana politicians to restrict \u2014 and even ban \u2014 access to abortion care,\" she said. \"Deeply personal decisions about abortion should be made by women in consultation with their doctors \u2014 not by politicians or government bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2F3Pa4D"}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/540661228/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Five-reasons-LeBron-James-and-the-Cavs-are-in-trouble-after-Game-loss-to-Pacers/", "published": "2018-04-21T03:33:06", "title": "Five reasons LeBron James and the Cavs are in trouble after Game 3 loss to Pacers", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: LeBron James got defensive when asked how he can get the most out of his teammates after the Cavaliers lost Game 3 to the Pacers to go down 2-1 in the series.

(Photo: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Indiana Pacers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 92-90 in Game 3 of their first-round Eastern Conference series on Friday, taking a 2-1 series lead.\n\nCleveland had a 17-point halftime lead and took a 71-63 lead into the fourth quarter, and this season a Cavs\u2019 lead headed into the fourth quarter had meant victory. Cleveland was 40-0 with a lead after three quarters this season until Friday\u2019s loss. Bojan Bogdanovic picked a perfect time to score a career-high 30 points, including seven three-pointers.\n\nGame 4 is Sunday in Indianapolis with Indiana in position to take a 3-1 lead.\n\nHere are five reasons the Cavs are in trouble and the Pacers can win this series.\n\n1. Pacers match up well with the Cavaliers\n\nTheir Game 1 victory wasn\u2019t a fluke and neither was their Game 3 victory. Coach Nate McMillan\u2019s team plays solid offense and defense, they\u2019re not afraid of the three-time defending Eastern Conference champions and they don\u2019t panic no matter how far behind they are against Cleveland. They were down 57-40 at halftime and made it a close game for the final quarter. Don\u2019t forget, Indiana beat Cleveland three of four times in the regular season.\n\n2. Pacers know how to stop LeBron James\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to eliminate James\u2019 impact on a game, but the Pacers have made it difficult for James to dominate. Lance Stephenson, Bogdanovic and Thaddeus Young \u2013 plus help defenders \u2013 have kept James in check as much as that\u2019s possible. Indiana\u2019s other defenders have done their job, too. Cleveland had just 20 points in the first 19 minutes, 30 seconds of the second half. The Cavs were 9 for 28 from the field and 1 for 12 on three-pointers and committed 10 turnovers in that stretch\n\nMore NBA\n\n3. The Cavs aren\u2019t getting enough help from players not named LeBron James or Kevin Love\n\nJames had 28 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists and Love had 19, but the rest of the team weren't significant contributors on the offensive end. Kyle Korver (zero points) and J.R. Smith were a combined 3 for 14 from the field. While George Hill had a decent game with 13 points, they\u2019re not getting the necessary scoring production from Larry Nance Jr., Rodney Hood and Jordan Clarkson. This Cleveland roster hasn\u2019t had a ton of time together since the big trade deadline deal in February, and that lack of chemistry/familiarity is hurting Cleveland.\n\n4. The Cavs can\u2019t hit their three-pointers\n\nOne of the best three-point shooting teams in the league, Cleveland shot just 31.3% in Game 3 and just 23.5% in Game 1. For a team that relies on the three ball, not making them has been detrimental.\n\n5. Cleveland just can\u2019t sustain the defensive effort for an entire game\n\nThe Cavs have held Indiana under 100 in all three games but when they needed stops in this series, the Cavs had serious trouble preventing Indiana from scoring. Victor Oladipo has done his thing (18 points in Game 3), and Bogdanovic not only is making an effort defensively against James, he torched Cleveland for 30 points in Game 3. He buried 7 of 9 threes. Young had 12 points.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter."}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/540597554/0/usatoday-newstopstories~IPhone-X-over-Apple-stock-tanks-on-sales-fears/", "published": "2018-04-20T23:25:13", "title": "IPhone X over?

The interceptor missiles appeared to lack guidance systems.\n\n\u201cNearly every one was launched after the last of our missiles hit their targets,\u201d Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said.\n\nThe failure highlights how ineffective Syria\u2019s military has become and the degree to which it now depends on Russia and Iran, its principal sponsors, for security, said Christopher Kozak, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S., French and British forces launched 105 missiles from aircraft and ships at three chemical weapons facilities in Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack launched by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nMore: U.S. airstrikes unlikely to deter Bashar Assad from chemical attacks in Syria\n\nMore: Pentagon used 'nice and new and smart' missiles in attack on Syria's chemical sites\n\nRussia claimed that Syrian defenses knocked down many incoming missiles, but the Pentagon said every weapon hit its intended target, dismissing the Russian comments as a disinformation campaign.\n\nSyria is equipped with a relatively sophisticated air defense system, but a lack of training, command and control and other human factors are probably responsible for the failure, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the physical capability of the air defense system,\u201d said David Deptula, a retired, three-star Air Force general. \u201cIt\u2019s about the people who are operating the system.\u201d\n\nImage of the Barzah Research and Development Center in Damascus, Syria before an airstrike by forces from the United States, Great Britain and France.

(Photo: satellite image \u00a92018 DigitalGl)\n\nThe Pentagon was careful to acknowledge that Russian\u2019s own air defense system in Syria, which is far more sophisticated than the Assad regime\u2019s, was not employed against the U.S. attack.\n\nThe Russian military passively tracked the incoming missiles on their radar as they blew up the three chemical weapons facilities targeted by the U.S., French and British missiles, which were launched from ships and aircraft operating outside Syrian airspace.\n\n\"Russian air defenses were energized,\" said Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, director of the joint staff. \"They did not choose to engage.\"\n\nThe modern S-400 air defense system that the Russians have in Syria is principally used for defending its two major bases inside the country.\n\nTo defend its airspace, Assad's military employs the older Russian-built S-200 air defense system, a network of radar and ground-to-air missiles that was first designed in the 1960s.\n\nSyria may also have the more modern Pantsir system, which is designed to defend individual bases or facilities and doesn\u2019t have the range to cover the entire country.\n\nSyria's military has been weakened after seven years of war. Its recent successes in retaking territory is largely the result of help from Russia, which has been supplying air power, and Iran, which has deployed ground troops.\n\nBarmah Research and Development Center in Damascus, Syria. (Photo: DigitalGlobe, via USA TODAY Network)\n\nAfter the U.S. attacked a Syrian airfield last year following a similar chemical attack on its people, Assad complained that his regime couldn\u2019t defend its air space because half the country\u2019s air defense system had been destroyed by the civil war.\n\nSeveral years prior to that, the Pentagon had described Syria\u2019s air defense system as a challenge for American forces.\n\nWhen the U.S. was weighing the option of establishing a no-fly zone over Syria, Gen. Martin Dempsey, then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said Syria\u2019s air defense system was \u201chigh end.\u201d\n\n\"I'm not saying we couldn't beat that system, but it would be a greater challenge, take longer and require greater resources,\" he said in 2013.\n\nBut even a sophisticated air defense system would have had trouble defending against the type of attack conducted by the U.S.-led coalition, analysts say.\n\nThe cruise missiles fly low and emit little heat for interceptor missiles to lock on to. They can also be programmed on a flight path that makes it difficult to predict where they will appear.\n\nThe sheer number of incoming missiles also makes them hard to track and hit at the same time. \u201cTheir systems would be overwhelmed by 100 cruise missiles,\u201d said Michael Pregent, an analyst at the Hudson Institute. Each battery has several dozen missiles and reloading takes nearly an hour.\n\nThe U.S. military would typically jam enemy radar when conducting airstrikes, making it difficult for the Syrians to employ their systems.\n\n\u201cAir defenses aren\u2019t invulnerable,\u201d Deptula said. \u201cWe just proved that.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2vzen7D"}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/540615094/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Could-we-please-for-the-love-of-all-things-good-stop-these-annoying-robocalls/", "published": "2018-04-20T20:40:10", "title": "Could we please, for the love of all things good, stop these annoying robocalls?", "text": "CLOSE Robocalls are still a plague.

And it\u2019s not even noon yet.\n\nConsumers get an estimated 98 million robocalls daily, according to government watchdog agencies. Fraud from these unwanted calls amounts to about $9.5 billion annually. And despite some wins against robocallers last year, this year is off to a tough start.\n\n\"We continue to bring cases and shut down as many folks as we can,\" said attorney Janice Kopec, the Federal Trade Commission's point person on robocalls. \u201cBut sophisticated auto-dialers make it really easy for scammers to make illegal calls from anywhere in the world and hide behind fake caller ID information.

(Photo: Jennifer Jolly/Special for USA TODAY)\n\nA few phone makers now offer built-in alerts for when a call is probably a fraud.\n\nSamsung's Smart Call alerts you if the number that\u2019s calling is a known robocaller. Smart Call comes with new Samsung Galaxy phones starting with the S7 and includes the Note 8.\n\nGoogle\u2019s spam blocker doesn\u2019t have a particular name, but it\u2019s even more powerful. On Google\u2019s Pixel phones, the default Google Phone app lights up your screen with a bright red warning telling you not to answer the spam calls. It\u2019s already a great feature, but a new update rolling out soon makes it even better by sending spam calls straight to voicemail and never bothering you with them.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Pixel phone, you can still download the Google Phone app for Android, which will replace your current Android calling app, and get the same great features.\n\nLet your carrier handle it\n\nAT&T's free Call Protect App blocks a scam call on my iPhone. (Photo: Jennifer Jolly/Special for USA TODAY)\n\nWireless carriers are sick and tired of robocalls, too. All the major carriers now have their own apps to stop spam calls, and most of them are free with your plan.\n\nAT&T: Call Protect (iOS, Android, free)\n\nAT&T\u2019s app can auto-block suspected fraud calls and alert you if a caller is likely a robocall spammer. If you find a spammer using a number that wasn\u2019t picked up, you can easily block them manually as well.\n\nVerizon: Caller Name ID (iOS, Android, free)\n\nCaller Name ID offers alerts for suspected spam callers before you bother to answer, as well as marks new spam numbers and shares blocked spam numbers with people on your contact list who also have the app.\n\nT-Mobile: Scam Block (Android, pre-installed, free)\n\nT-Mobile customers with Android phones get a handy scam-blocker built right into their phones. The feature (which you enable by dialing #662#) automatically blocks known scam call numbers without any additional setup. A second helpful app, also preinstalled on T-Mobile smartphones running Android, is called Name ID. It labels unknown numbers as possible spam if they\u2019ve been reported in the past.\n\nSprint: Premium Caller ID (iOS, Android, $2.99/Month)\n\nUnlike the previous three carriers, Sprint\u2019s solution to spam call blocking is a bit different. It\u2019s a paid monthly service that lets you register your name. This helps the carrier figure out who is a real caller so that it can alert you of potential spammers and robocallers. It works with any iOS or Android phone on Sprint\u2019s network, and you don\u2019t have to install any additional apps.\n\nDownload an app\n\nThe Nomorobo app stops a call on my phone. (Photo: Jennifer Jolly/Special for USA TODAY)\n\nApps such as Nomorobo, Truecaller, Hiya, RoboKiller and YouMail really can cull the stream of con-artist calls. Many of the apps are free for at least a week, then cost around $2 a month or nearly $20 a year after that. (The apps present this to you as \u201cupgrades\u201d or \u201cpremium,\u201d which you inevitably want to ditch ads or get the best the tech has to offer.)\n\nI\u2019ve used all of them and really like AT&T\u2019s free Call Protect, as well as Nomorobo, for how simple they are overall. Nomorobo stops working well every three to four months, but if I go into the settings and \u201crefresh\u201d it, it gets better at screening out scam calls again. YouMail is also great because it delivers a message to known scammers that your number is out of service, which takes the target off your head. At least for now.\n\nUse the Do Not Call Registry\n\nColumnist Jennifer Jolly with a robocaller. (Photo: Roddy Blelloch/Special for USA TODAY)\n\nAs much as it might feel like it doesn\u2019t help, it\u2019s still a good practice to add your numbers to the National Do Not Call Registry. If your number is on the registry and you do get unwanted calls, report them. Basically, this gives the good-guys at least one way to fight the bad guys, who have plenty of incentive to keep trying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sheer numbers game, and the economics are simple.

I am 56, and have never voted for a Democrat in a presidential election. I am a white, middle-aged attorney living and working where I was born. I\u2019m an evangelical Christian. I am pro-life. I cling to my guns and religion.\n\nSome may call me a \u201cdeplorable.\u201d My life is a caricature of a Donald Trump supporter. But I am not. I never have been. From day one, I knew enough about his celebrity act, his business and personal practices, and his prior support of liberal causes to know he was not a person I would want as commander in chief.\n\nPresident Trump has lived his entire life as a man to whom the rules do not apply, be they rules of polite behavior, rules of marital fidelity, rules against sexual exploitation and rules of law. The president now threatens to be the judge of his own campaign\u2019s conduct, acting as a medieval king who is above the law and takes what he wants, answering to no one. When a man reveals his true character, believe him, and react accordingly.\n\nHere\u2019s my reaction: Trump\u2019s attack on the investigation headed by Robert Mueller is wrong, and fails to put America first. He and his campaign are subject to scrutiny for wrongdoing, just like every other American. Far from the investigation being a disgrace as the president claims, it would be a disgrace to not thoroughly evaluate possible wrongdoing.\n\nMore: I'm still a Republican, but my party needs to be fumigated\n\nMore: Comey is back to remind us how Trump got elected. Where's our apology?\n\nI seriously doubt the president colluded with any Russians, and he knows best what a completed investigation will reveal on that point. I do not have that same confidence level in his subordinates. As the president himself noted at one point, he needs to know if any subordinates were disloyal and involved a foreign power in our election. Insistence on a thorough vetting would be putting America first.\n\nI naively thought Trump\u2019s campaign was over when he slandered Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s service because he was captured with his body broken into pieces. It obviously was not. Now Trump is attacking another decorated war hero, Mueller, who despite being wounded in battle as a young man, kept heroically leading his troops. Since his military service, Mueller has spent decades in public service acclaimed by all \u2014 especially Republicans.\n\nThe efforts to delegitimize the investigation represent a precursor to ending the investigation by presidential fiat. We\u2019re reading a page from Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s playbook to attack those who investigate wrongdoing and witnesses who speak to that misconduct.\n\nCompare the Clintons\u2019 attacks on \u201cthat woman\u201d (a barely adult Monica Lewinsky) and other women they labeled as bimbos, with Trump\u2019s verbal assaults on those who speak against him. Compare the president\u2019s missives against Mueller and those working with him to the Clintons\u2019 attacks on Ken Starr. The Republican leaders now are just like the Democratic leaders then. God has a sense of humor: Trump\u2019s base, in its hatred of the Clintons, nominated and elected the only Republican who can approach the Clintons in mendacity and dishonor.\n\nMore: Roy Moore is the last straw, you can now call me a Democrat\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAnd the dishonesty cannot be understated. Trump falsely states that Mueller \u2014 a lifelong Republican \u2014 has a conflict of interest, without bothering to identify that conflict. Perhaps the \u201cconflict\u201d is the gall to aggressively investigate his campaign and associates.\n\nThe president also claims the investigation is \u201cheaded up by Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama.\u201d Fact check: None of them worked for former president Obama, any more than they now work for Trump. If employment during any given administration translates to bias for federal officials, can we then say that Trump is being investigated by his own employees who are biased for him? The reality is that any experienced public servant will serve under multiple administrations.\n\nMost egregiously, the president has stated the Mueller investigation is \u201can attack on our country in a true sense, it's an attack on what we all stand for.\u201d This statement provides a succinct example of why I disagreed with his Republican nomination and object to much of his current \u201cleadership.\u201d While claiming to make America great, he does not know what already has made America great \u2014 we are a nation of laws, not men. That is what we stand for: Equality of all before the law. The Mueller investigation goes to the very core of why America has been a beacon of freedom over two centuries.\n\nWe should all let Trump know we are Americans, not loyal subjects. The Mueller investigation must run its course, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nRick Hall is a practicing attorney and a legal adviser to Republicans for the Rule of Law.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

When I was growing up, plastic was practically a sibling.\n\nMy father was an executive of Dow Chemical, then makers of dozens of kinds of plastic, including the Saran Wrap most readers have in their kitchen. When Dad saw an interesting piece of plastic, he\u2019d reach out and reverently feel it, saying, \u201cHmmmmm, polypropylene,\u201d or \u201cI think that\u2019s linear low-density polyethylene.\u201d\n\nThough he is long retired from the plastics-industry consulting firm he founded, his love affair continues. He wasn't the guy who gave one word of advice to 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate, but he could have been.

Back then, the fear was that plastic was overrunning our landfills and we were running out of places to put trash. Those fears turned out to be overblown, and the outcry has largely died off.\n\nThis weekend, another plastic story is going to be on front pages and newscasts across the country. Earth Day\u2019s theme, as proclaimed by the \u201cEarth Day Network,\u201d is \u201cEnd Plastic Pollution.\u201d And the picture-ready poster children for the problem are giant floating trash piles in the middle of the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nAs the Earth Day Network puts it in its \u201cPlastic Pollution Primer and Action Toolkit,\u201d the problem is vast: \u201cThese huge concentrations of plastic debris cover large swaths of the ocean; the one between California and Hawaii is the size of the state of Texas. \u2026 Scientists predict that if nothing changes in our plastic consumption habits, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than there are fish (by weight).\u201d\n\nMore: Congrats, Google, you found the worst way to build diversity\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe images are pretty ghastly. What is the answer this Earth Day, according to the network? \u201cThe most important step we can take to limit the amount of plastic pollution that makes its way into our oceans is to reduce the amount of plastic we consume in the first place.\u201d The group then suggests we all audit our own plastic use and cut back on our plastic bags, straws, cutlery and bottles, among other sins against nature.\n\nBut before Americans get too worked up about this latest blight on the reputation of plastics, there are a few facts about those vast piles of plastic floating in the ocean that you might not have heard:\n\n\u25baThey aren\u2019t made of plastic bags and straws; they\u2019re mostly made of abandoned fishing equipment.\n\n\u25baA second big contributor wasn\u2019t man throwing things away, but a tsunami striking Japan and sweeping all kinds of things out to sea.\n\n\u25baWhile thousands of tons of the plastic floating out there were thrown away, they weren\u2019t thrown away here.

The plan could open nearly all US coastlines to oil and gas drilling. (Feb. 8) AP\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to expand offshore oil drilling and slash safety regulations at the same time. This is a recipe for disaster.\n\nFire boat crews battle the blazing remnants of Deepwater Horizon on April 21, 2010. (Photo: Coast Guard, via AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Interior Department\u2019s proposal to open up nearly all coastal waters to offshore drilling has been met with a striking level of opposition, even by the standards of the Trump era. When the comment period ended last month, approximately 1.35 million comments had been registered against the plan. There was bipartisan resistance from governors in all but one of the coastal states that do not currently allow offshore drilling. And 12 attorneys general signed a letter saying they intend to sue the administration if the plan goes forward.\n\nIn response to this backlash, the message from the administration has been, again and again, that the risks from offshore drilling have been minimized \u2014 that now, it\u2019s safe.\n\nI was on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, which killed 11 workers and spewed 3 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico eight years ago Friday. I was tapped to serve because, among other things, I led the implementation of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan.\n\nMore: Drill offshore if necessary, but do it safely\n\nMore: Trump administration offshore drilling move reeks of illegal political favoritism\n\nOur job on the Deepwater Horizon commission was to investigate the root causes of the tragedy and to make recommendations on how to prevent and mitigate the impact of future spills. But over the past few months, the administration has been quietly rolling back the regulations that were adopted in the wake of the disaster.\n\nThe rules the commission suggested were not designed to be retributive. They are not overly restrictive. They are basic, commonsense standards to make sure that the companies we allow to profit off of our shared resources do not destroy them in the process.\n\nThe next time someone insists that offshore drilling is safe, I suggest asking them three questions:\n\n\u25baFirst, the Deepwater Horizon tragedy was caused by a series of major safety oversights \u2014 from bad cement sealing the well, to multiple faulty valves, to misinterpretation of pressure tests, to a broken gas detection system on board. Can you guarantee that safety lapses and mistakes like these are now being caught before they lead to catastrophe?\n\nOur commission recommended something that, frankly, seemed fairly obvious: having independent auditors inspect safety and pollution prevention equipment. The administration has removed this rule. Instead, the industry itself will perform these checks \u2014 just like it did (and, clearly, often failed to do) before the Deepwater Horizon disaster.\n\n\u25baSecond, the Deepwater Horizon National Commission report found that the industry\u2019s ability to control a failed well, particularly in extreme conditions, was inadequate. Are these well-control systems now reliable?\n\nFor instance, we found that before Deepwater Horizon, studies had suggested that blowout preventers \u2014 the last line of defense when it comes to maintaining control of a well \u2014 had high failure rates particularly when used in deep water. And that\u2019s exactly what happened in Deepwater Horizon: The blowout preventer didn\u2019t work.\n\nIn the wake of our report, industry experts and regulators worked together to negotiate a Well-Control and Blowout Preventer Rule that would establish new safety procedures. The process took six years and thousands of hours of consultation. Today, because of pressure from the industry, this rule is being overhauled. Many of the requirements are being weakened \u2014 changes that, taken together, are estimated to save the industry $986 million over the next 10 years.\n\nIn addition, many small, independent companies are beginning to move into deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet they often have terrible safety records, and lack the resources required to respond quickly to a spill and pay for cleanup and restoration.\n\n\u25baThird, currently, 97% of the oil produced from offshore drilling in the U.S. comes from the Gulf of Mexico. New environments will bring new, unexpected challenges. Have we proved that companies can navigate challenges specific to the new environments available to them?\n\nAs safety procedures for offshore drilling are being weakened, the dangers are growing as it is attempted in new environments. For instance, in the Arctic \u2014 a treasure trove of oil resources that\u2019s newly accessible because of melting ice \u2014 oil companies could face hurricane-force winds, constant darkness and temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit. In these environments, there's no nearby Coast Guard, no nearby cities full of engineers and supplies to fall back on. There are few requirements in place for companies to prove that they\u2019re capable of managing new challenges such as these.\n\nMore: On mpg standards, let California be California\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAdd it all up, and it\u2019s clear that we must ask these three questions, loudly and often \u2014 because if the answer to any of them is no, then chances are there will be a moment in the near future when another well blows and oil starts seeping into the sea. We\u2019ll watch as ecosystems are destroyed, as food supplies are poisoned, as communities are devastated. Coastal cafes and fisheries will be boarded up. Community members will suffer life-altering health consequences. Beaches that were once vibrant and full, places where wildlife thrived and people came together, will be desolate.\n\nAnd leaders in industry and in government will paint it all as an unpredictable tragedy, a terrible mishap, a sad accident.\n\nDon\u2019t buy it.\n\nExpanding access to drilling is incredibly risky. Weakening vital safety standards is cause for even graver concern. But doing both at the same time? That\u2019s a near-certain recipe for disaster.\n\nTerry Garcia, the CEO of Exploration Ventures, is former Chief Science & Exploration Officer at National Geographic, former assistant secretary of Commerce for Oceans & Atmosphere, and former deputy administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

(Photo: Branden Camp, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Democratic National Committee filed a lawsuit Friday against the Russian government, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, alleging they conspired to influence the 2016 election in favor of President Trump.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Russia found a \"willing and active partner\" in the Trump campaign, which shared the goals of hurting the Democratic Party and electing Donald Trump. It says representatives of the three groups remained in contact with each other as the cyberattack was being carried out.\n\n\"This constituted an act of unprecedented treachery: the campaign of a nominee for President of the United States in league with a hostile foreign power to bolster its own chance to win the presidency,\" DNC Chair Tom Perez said in a statement Friday.\n\nSeveral U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January 2017 report that Russian agents hacked the DNC's computers as part of a broader influence campaign aimed at hurting the campaign of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe cyberattack on the DNC's computers was a \"major component of the Russian interference campaign,\" according to the DNC. In 2015 and 2016, Russian intelligence agents hacked into DNC computer systems, stole DNC documents and emails, and used WikiLeaks and fake personas operated by Russian intelligence to disseminate the stolen materials to voters, the DNC alleges.\n\n\"They successfully hacked the Democratic Party in 2016 and they will be back,\" Perez said. \"We must prevent future attacks on our democracy, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing today.\"\n\nTrump's campaign manager Brad Parscale called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and said the campaign will fight back aggressively, potentially using the discovery process to explore DNC records. That includes funding the DNC reportedly contributed to research the \"dossier\" alleging ties between Trump and Russia, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,\u201d Parscale said in a statement. \"While this lawsuit is frivolous and will be dismissed, if the case goes forward, the DNC has created an opportunity for us to take aggressive discovery into their claims of \u2018damages\u2019 and uncover their acts of corruption for the American people.\"\n\nTrump tweeted Friday evening that the lawsuit \"can be good\" because the Trump campaign can now counter sue for more information from the DNC and from former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, whom he incorrectly referred to as \"Wendy Wasserman Schultz.\" There is an American playwright named Wendy Wasserstein.\n\nJust heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018\n\nResponding on Twitter, Wikileaks said the DNC was seeking publicity with its lawsuit and defended its release of the committee's emails, saying it helped expose the \"DNC rigged its primaries on behalf of Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nFriday's lawsuit opens another legal challenge to Trump and his allies, who already are contending with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said his campaign did not collude with the Russian government, and he has called investigations into the matter a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe DNC says its lawsuit is based on \"facts, admissions of defendants in multiple criminal proceedings, including their own words, records that have been released in legal filings, the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community and widely confirmed news reports.\"\n\nRelated: Why Trump's desire to fire Mueller may invite obstruction case and why it's such a big deal\n\nRussia investigation: What's next for congressional probes?\n\nDonald Trump's ties to Russia go back 30 years\n\nThe cyberattack created chaos throughout the campaign for Democrats, deepening divisions within the party. Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who ran in the Democratic presidential primary, were furious over emails that suggested DNC officials were hostile toward his campaign and favored Clinton. The scandal forced the DNC's chairwoman at the time, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, to step down from her post.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the Russian government notified the Trump campaign in advance that it had stolen Democratic emails and other information about the Democratic Party that it was seeking to use in support of Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nRather than report Russia\u2019s intentions to interfere with elections, \u201cthe Trump campaign and its agents gleefully welcomed Russia\u2019s help,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nRussian agents transmitted data to WikiLeaks, which disseminated the information at key moments to boost the Trump campaign, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nTrump\u2019s closest political adviser, Roger Stone, who is named as a defendant, also appeared to have advance knowledge of specific plans by WikiLeaks to disseminate some of this information, the lawsuit alleges. Throughout the campaign, Trump associates remained in contact with individuals closely connected to the Kremlin and Russian intelligence agencies, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit also names Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as defendants. Other individual defendants include Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Jr., former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, and Manafort's business partner, Richard Gates, who have all been charged in Mueller's investigation.\n\nPapadopoulous and Gates pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a federal agent, and Gates also pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy against the United States. Manafort has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe lawsuit refers to the Trump campaign as a \"racketeering enterprise\" that sought to exploit the DNC's \"trade secrets.\" The lawsuit also cites a federal computer fraud law that allows victims of hacking to pursue damages in civil court.\n\nNick Ackerman, a former Watergate prosecutor and an expert on computer security issues, said the DNC\u2019s move could pose significant legal risks for Trump\u2019s allies because it could allow the party to begin \u201ctaking depositions and getting documents\u201d to prove their allegations. It also provides another avenue to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election beyond Mueller's investigation.\n\n\u201cIf Mueller were fired, they could continue with this,\u201d Ackerman said of the Democratic Party. \u201cTrump can\u2019t pardon anybody in a civil case. He can\u2019t stop the civil case.\u201d\n\n\"It really does give the Democratic National Committee a means to go after people hard and heavy here,\" he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign already is battling another civil lawsuit over hacked emails. In that case, two Democratic donors and a former DNC staffer have argued the release of DNC emails violated their privacy. That case was brought by Protect Democracy, a watchdog group run by a former Obama administration lawyer.\n\nThe Trump campaign is seeking to dismiss that case, arguing in court filings that it is a \u201cdisruptive, politically motivated lawsuit\u201d that threatens to interfere with Trump\u2019s presidential duties and with Mueller\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation. A hearing on the Trump campaign\u2019s motion to toss out the Protect Democracy lawsuit is set for next month.\n\nContributing: Erin Kelly\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2qJCz2k"}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/539882152/0/usatoday-newstopstories~Spending-a-Motheraposs-Day-with-Barbara-Bush/", "published": "2018-04-18T17:46:12", "title": "Spending a Mother's Day with Barbara Bush", "text": "CLOSE Barbara Pierce Bush, the former first lady, died at her Houston home Tuesday after a long struggle with congestive heart failure and pulmonary disease.

So it was amazing, really, the gift she gave to 92 graduates of the Class of 1989 at a tiny African-American women's college in Greensboro, N.C.\n\nThree decades ago, I was among the 2,500 who sat on folded chairs in the quadrangle of Bennett College on that crisp afternoon marveling at the fact that the sitting first lady had chosen Bennett as the only college at which she would speak that year.\n\nMrs. Bush, 92, died at her Houston home Tuesday after a long struggle with congestive heart failure and pulmonary disease.

Children from a successful foster care placement agency in town gave her gifts. Mrs. Bush kneeled to meet them eye-to-eye.\n\nAs unlikely as it seemed for many to believe that Mrs. Bush was there, it was her family's relationship with President Gloria Randle Scott, a fellow Texan, that helped seal the deal. Scott was named to the education advisory board of President-elect George H.W. Bush in 1987. She later met Mrs. Bush at a United Negro College Fund event in New York. They became friends.\n\nScott shared Bennett's history with Mrs. Bush. It was founded in the late 1800s by the United Methodist Church. It became an all-girls school in 1926. Eleanor Roosevelt visited in 1945 to speak at the school's 19th annual \"Homemaking Institute.\"\n\n\"She was what I would call a down-to-earth person, but a very, very smart woman,\" Scott, 80, told me the other day from her home in Corpus Christi, Texas. \"She was very intellectually smart and thinks things through.\"\n\nBennett College gave the first lady an honorary degree, making her part of a small sorority of 6,000 \"Bennett Belles,\" as the school's graduates (including Cincinnati Public School Superintendent Laura Mitchell) are known. Scott said she was going to ask the school to send the Bush family a bouquet of yellow roses, the official flower of Texas, the same kind Bennett gave the first lady in 1989 when she spoke there.\n\nI always liked Barbara Bush better than President Bush from the very beginning. It was all based on the superficial stuff. She was matronly. Her face was wrinkled. Her hair seemed prematurely white. She looked tough, but her eyes always twinkled.

(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\nBut Trump's acceptance of popular state legalization reflects the reality and power of this increasingly important industry. Across the country, cannabis legalization is transforming communities in ways big and small, winning many converts among skeptical cops and local politicians as new tax dollars pour into schools and scholarships, pay for road paving and drug treatment, and, if advocates have their way, lift up minority communities devastated by the War on Drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun to see people\u2019s minds change,\u201d Jen Lujan of California-based marijuana firm Eaze said.\n\nMarijuana\u2019s economic impact in particular has helped keep the focus on the positives of legalization. While most supporters agree that marijuana taxes haven\u2019t been the boon many expected, the industry\u2019s economic power is undeniable.\n\nAt least 121,000 people are already working directly in the nation\u2019s home-grown marijuana industry, tending plants, trimming leaves and selling cannabis products to eager consumers, according to BDS Analytics and Arcview Market Research. For comparison, there are fewer than 50,000 coal miners, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe Potcast, a USA TODAY Network podcast, tells the story of America\u2019s shifting attitude toward legalizing pot:\n\nNine states \u2014 Alaska, California, Colorado, Oregon, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada, Vermont and Washington, along with Washington D.C., \u2014 have legalized recreational pot use, although not all of them permit and tax sales. Those states selling pot have collected more than $1.6 billion in taxes since their legalization programs began, and California\u2019s launch of legal sales earlier this year is expected to supercharge that number.\n\nGlass jars of marijuana offered for sale at the Medicine Man cannabis dispensary in Denver. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\nMedical and recreational cannabis sales will hit $11.7 billion this year, predicts cannabis analytics firm New Frontier Data, increase by 25% in 2019 and hit $25 billion in seven years. For comparison, wine sales in the United States were worth $60 billion last year, according to the Beverage Information and Insights Group. For risk-taking entrepreneurs, cannabis holds the promise of a vast new industry that's entirely homegrown.\n\nHow the federal government acts could change that dramatically. President Obama's administration had promised it would leave well-run state marijuana programs alone, but Sessions rescinded that promise in January, throwing the industry into chaos. Many traditional investors have shied away from pouring their capital into the industry over fears they'd be treated like drug traffickers, and a strong sign of support from Trump over Congressional action might provide the reassurance they're seeking.\n\nLast week, U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner said Trump promised him he'd respect states' rights when it comes to legal pot and would support a federal-level change to bring consistency. Several members of Congress have introduced bills to either legalize cannabis entirely or at least remove it as a Schedule 1 controlled substance.\n\n\"By supporting this law, President Trump has arguably done more to advance the growth of the regulated cannabis industry than any other president,\" said Isaac Dietrich, CEO of marijuana services firm MassRoots.\n\nBecause legalization has happened almost entirely at state ballot boxes, the United States has so far avoided having a national conversation about the broader implications of increased use and availability. That troubles legalization opponents such as Kevin Sabet of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, the nation\u2019s leading anti-cannabis organization. SAM has been fighting a state-by-state battle against legalization on the grounds that increased access will lead to increased use. SAM supports increased access to drug treatment and a reduction or elimination of criminal penalties for minor marijuana consumption but opposes broad legalization.\n\nA box of joints awaits customers at the Harborside Health Center in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\n\"This reckless plan will not go unanswered,\" Sabet said.\n\nWhether there really is a plan remains uncertain, and many marijuana industry experts say they'll believe Trump only once there's a law in place. In dealing with a president who sets policy via Twitter, they want to see actual legislation.\n\n\"This is another head-spinning moment,\" said Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat and leading voice for federal legalization. \"We should hope for the best, but not take anything for granted. Trump changes his mind constantly, and Republican leadership is still in our way.\"\n\nA USA TODAY survey in January found hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing from the cannabis industry into campaign finance accounts of both lawmakers and political action committees, with emphasis this year on Congressional Republicans who control the agenda. Democrats typically have been the largest recipients of marijuana campaign money in the past, but Republicans are now taking the lead in accepting those donations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzed contributions at the request of USA TODAY. Experts say the recent shift is largely attributable to the belief by marijuana businesses that Republicans who support states' rights are their best allies today.\n\nBut in the industry's increasing clout, legalization critics see echoes of a time when Big Tobacco called the shots. Critics see worrying similarities in how the marijuana industry makes broad health claims about its products while simultaneously touting its economic impact. Cigarette manufacturers made similar claims, and the health costs of tobacco use, including lung cancer, are widely acknowledged to dwarf the industry's benefits.\n\n\"Tobacco Road also hired a lot of people and kept a lot of people employed,\" said Deni Carise, an addiction expert and chief scientific officer at Recovery Centers of America. \"I think (marijuana legalization) is going to cost our country a lot of money.\u201d\n\nAdds Sabet: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to let someone grow a little pot at home. It\u2019s another entirely to get Madison Avenue involved. This isn\u2019t something that Cheech and Chong would have ever envisioned. The people in suits have taken over.\u201d\n\nA cloud of marijuana smoke hangs over the annual 4/20 rally April 20, 2017, in Denver. Experts say they have no clear answers on how widespread marijuana legalization will affect our society. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY)\n\nLegalization supporters brush off those concerns, arguing that the War on Drugs for too long has demonized a plant widely used by humans for thousands of years. They say it's about time national politicians recognize that marijuana legalization is the right thing to do. And they say if the nation's economy can benefit, all the better.\n\n\u201cNow, finally seeing that momentum, seeing that shift, it\u2019s pretty amazing. And it\u2019s happening quickly, quicker than maybe even the regulators are ready for. I don\u2019t think anybody realized how big this industry really is,\" said Dennis Hunter, founder of California-based premium marijuana supplier CannaCraft. \"Everybody\u2019s aware of it right now, but it\u2019s getting normalized, and in a couple years we\u2019ll all just accept it.\u201d\n\nPreston Mekelburg, 22, weighs and packages marijuana at the Medicine Man cannabis dispensary in Denver.

(Photo: JACK GRUBER/USA TODAY)\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Hundreds of well-wishers and admirers paid their final respects Friday to Barbara Bush, the former first lady whose no-nonsense, matriarchal style transcended politics and touched people across the nation.\n\nAttendees came from Florida, Washington and across Texas, arriving as early as 8 a.m. on a chilly morning to Second Baptist Church on Woodway Drive. From there, they were shuttled to the public viewing at St. Martin\u2019s Episcopal Church, where Bush and husband George H.W. Bush reguarly attended services while living in Houston.\n\nAn invitation-only funeral service is scheduled for Saturday at St. Martin's. Later, a motorcade will carry her body 90 miles northwest to the George Bush Presidential Library Center on the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, near which she will be laid to rest.\n\nBut on Friday, it was about the public's chance to pay their last respects.\n\nJessica Queener, 39, of Washington, was in Houston on business and took time out to attend the service. Bush\u2019s work to combat illiteracy and champion those with disabilities was a main motivator, she said. \u201cHer and her husband worked so tirelessly for Americans with disabilities,\u201d Queener said. \u201cI have a huge amount of admiration and respect for both of them.\u201d\n\nHer husband, Mitchell Queener, accompanied her and said he most admired the Bushes\u2019s dignity. \u201cMrs. Bush and the president were individuals of high character,\u201d he said.\n\nMany women attendees wore pearl necklaces to Barbara Bush's public viewing in Houston on Friday, in honor of the first lady, who favored wearing pearls.

Her body was to be in repose from noon until midnight. Among the officials allowed in earlier were the Senate\u2019s majority whip, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both Republicans.\n\nA spray of pink, yellow and white flowers covered Bush's closed silver casket, as the mourners streamed past. Visitors got a surprise visit from George H.W. Bush who appeared in his wheelchair alongside his daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch, to greet and shake hands with visitors as they walked past the casket.\n\nLucy Orlando was one of the more than 100 people in line 90 minutes before bus service began, travelling from Weston, Florida, to pay her respects. Originally from Haiti, the 74-year-old Orlando said has admired Bush for many years, including her work in promoting literacy.\n\n\u201cShe was a very sweet lady and she loves people,\u201d said Orlando, who was carrying a gray suitcase containing framed photos of the couple and members of their family, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura.\n\nKathy Vigelow, 55, of Houston, said there was never any doubt she would use her day off to pay last respects to Bush. The Bushes had displayed a respect for the office of the president and for Americans and she wanted to return some of that, she said.\n\n\"There was no question,\" Vigelow said as she waited in line to board the buses that would take her to St. Martin's. \"I had to do it.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2HPaQV1"}, {"link": "http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/540626600/0/usatoday-newstopstories~of-the-largest-royal-weddings-ever/", "published": "2018-04-20T22:03:53", "title": "30 of the largest royal weddings, ever", "text": "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge drive from Buckingham Palace in a decorated sports car on April 29, 2011 in London, England.

(Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) ORIG FILE ID: 113270944 (Photo: Jeff J Mitchell, Getty Images)\n\nReceiving an invitation to a wedding is a big deal, especially if those getting married are near and dear to you. On average, 120 people get the save the date card to a typical American wedding. Imagine, though, if you had to invite the heads of state of nearly every monarchy, members of your nation\u2019s government, and all of your extended family.\n\nWhen you hail from royal blood, the guest list must not disappoint. 24/7 Wall St. sifted through a wealth of news sites to identify the largest royal weddings by attendance in the past century.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that our compilation of largely attended weddings, while impressive, is not comprehensive. Of the hundreds of royal weddings of the past century, some have not made their guest list and attendance numbers available to the public.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding: What we know and what we don't know\n\nAmong the largest royal weddings, several nations and monarchies are represented, including smaller civilizations like the Polynesian kingdom of Tonga and the southeast Asia nation of Brunei. The range of attendees at each of these weddings spans from a couple hundred to tens of thousands.\n\nInterestingly enough, quite a few of these glamorous weddings did not proceed to have a sustainable marriage. Several of the these marriages ended in divorce just a few years after the wedding. Other large weddings were downright controversial. Take the Prince of Tonga, for example, who denounced familial disapproval and took his cousin\u2019s hand in marriage in the summer of 2012, claiming, \u201cLove before protocol.\u201d\n\nBritain's Prince Harry will marry American actress Meghan Markle in England on May 19. (Photo: Daniel Leal-Olivas, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe most publicized royal weddings are those of British royalty. The marriage of Prince Charles of Wales to the late Diana Spencer is perhaps the most famous royal wedding of all time. Not only did 3,500 people attend the wedding at Westminster Abbey, but also more than half a million people lined the streets of London that same day in an attempt to spot the newlywed royal couple. And a reported 750 million people had tuned in to watch the couple\u2019s apprehensive kiss atop the balcony of the Buckingham Palace.\n\nMore: Publishers rush to the altar with new books about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\n\nThe next royal wedding of interest that has everyone talking is the upcoming marriage between Prince Harry and actress Meghan Markle. Markle will be the first woman of color in the modern era to marry into the overwhelmingly white royal British family. This will be the American actress\u2019 second marriage. The first, to film producer Trevor Engelson, only lasted two years.\n\nThe groundbreaking wedding will take place at Kensington Palace on May 19. It will be interesting to see if the wedding\u2019s attendance numbers will top that of William and Kate\u2019s, whose wedding also made this list.\n\nPrince Philippe of Belgium and his wife Princess Mathilde pictured in 2013.

Pesky guard Matthew Dellavedova, a veteran of a championship run with the Cleveland Cavaliers, helped hold young Celtics point guard Terry Rozier to nine points on 2-of-7 shooting.\n\n\"The activity, if you take the stat sheet out of it, the activity and the energy that we brought ... as you go through the game, that's what you need, is the energy first,\" coach Joe Prunty said.\n\nAl Horford scored 16 for the Celtics, who fell behind by 23 at halftime and got no closer than 76-62 with 3:06 left in the third quarter on Jayson Tatum's 3-pointer.\n\nThe game was so well in hand that the Bucks closed out the victory even with Antetokounmpo on the bench for much of the fourth quarter with five fouls. Middleton had eight points in the fourth.\n\nGame 4 is Sunday in Milwaukee. The Celtics will need to get off to a much better start if they want to avoid going home for Game 5 with a 2-2 series tie.\n\n\"We got into a hole. This is new for our group,\" Horford said. \"They had it going ... and we really didn't have an answer for them tonight.\"\n\nMilwaukee hustled for loose balls and stayed active around the paint, used its length to get deflections and disrupt Boston in the lane.\n\nThe 7-foot-1 Maker, in particular, provided a huge boost to help Milwaukee counter what had been a decisive edge off the bench for the Celtics. Maker got extended minutes only because starting center John Henson missed the game with a sore back.\n\nNearly everything else went Milwaukee's way, too.\n\nParker, who voiced displeasure this week after playing just 24 minutes over the first two games, was 7 of 12 from the field and played 30 minutes. Bledsoe, outplayed by Rozier in the first two games, shot 8 of 13.\n\n\"Good win, lots of positives tonight. Quick turnaround ... so we'll have to do it again on Sunday,\" Prunty said.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCeltics: Rozier had five turnovers, but four came in a first quarter in which the Celtics fell behind 27-12. He had nine assists ... Boston held a 45-37 edge in rebounding, including 17-7 on the offensive glass. But the Celtics allowed the Bucks to shoot at least 57 percent for a second straight game.\n\nBucks: Malcolm Brogdon replaced Tony Snell at guard alongside Bledsoe. Brogdon, who missed two months late in the season with a quad injury, scored five points but helped limit the Celtics' backcourt of Rozier and Jaylen Brown (11 points). ...

(AP Photo/Bill Boyce) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Michael Wacha has been nearly unbeatable against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nWacha kept up his strong pitching against Cincinnati, Yadier Molina hit two-run double in the first inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals won 4-2 Friday night to spoil Jim Riggleman's debut as Reds interim manager.\n\nWacha (3-1) gave up one run and six hits in 6 2/3 innings, his longest outing of the year, to improve to 10-1 in his career against the Reds.\n\n\"I don't know what it is. I just have a good record against them I guess,\" Wacha said. \"I try not to think who's out there, who I'm facing but just trying to attack every single team that comes in here. I really can't put my finger on what it is honestly.\"\n\nCardinals Manager Mike Matheny had his own ideas as to why Wacha has been so successful against the Reds.\n\n\"Michael, you know he's got good stuff,\" Matheny said. \"You throw him out there often enough against anybody, I think he's going to get his share of wins and just watch him continue to improve.\"\n\nJose Martinez had three hits and an RBI, raising his batting average to .358 this season. He has eight RBIs over his last seven games. Tommy Pham scored twice as the Cardinals gave Wacha a 4-0 lead after two innings.\n\n\"We went out there and tried to be aggressive,\" Martinez said. \"The plan was to go out there and score first and we did it so I felt like we set the tone and (Wacha) kept us in the game and that was good.\"\n\nBud Norris picked up his fifth save in five chances despite allowing a two-out RBI single to Alex Blandino, helping the Cardinals win for the sixth time in seven games.\n\nBrandon Finnegan (0-2) lost for the second time in two starts against the Cardinals this year. Finnegan came off the disabled list (left biceps strain) April 14th. He allowed five hits and four runs while walking four over three innings.\n\nRiggleman replaced Bryan Price, who was fired Thursday after Cincinnati lost 15 of its first 18 games. The Reds have now lost 11 of their last 12.\n\nPham, who scored on Molina's bases-loaded double in the first, walked in the second and scored on Martinez's double to make it 4-0.\n\nThe Reds' only damage against Wacha came in the third as Billy Hamilton scored on Jose Peraza's sacrifice fly. It was Cincinnati's first run since the eighth inning against Milwaukee on Monday, ending a 21-inning scoreless streak. Last season the Reds season-high scoreless streak was 20 innings.\n\nWhile Riggleman wasn't happy with the outcome he seemed pleased to get the chance to manage again.\n\n\"It wasn't quite riding a bike,\" Riggleman said. \"I was very excited to get the opportunity again. We want to do some good things and carry on (Bryan Price's) message and our guys did. They played hard. We want to go hard on behalf of everybody and this city (Cincinnati), the fans. They deserve better baseball and they're going to get better baseball.\"\n\nFOURTH TIME'S A CHARM\n\nThe Reds appointment of Riggleman as interim manager marks the fourth time in his career that he has held this position. He previously was named interim manager in San Diego, Seattle and Washington. He was promoted to manager everywhere but Seattle. Riggleman also managed the Chicago Cubs (1995-1998) and managed in the Cardinals' minor league system (1982-'88).\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nReds: OF Scott Schebler was activated from the 10-day disabled list and LHP Cody Reed (0-0, four appearances) was optioned to Triple-A Louisville. Schebler was on the DL with a right ulnar nerve contusion.\n\nCardinals: RHP Sam Tuivailala threw a bullpen session Friday and St. Louis president of baseball operations John Mozeliak said Tuivailala will begin an official rehabilitation assignment the middle of next week. Tuivailala was placed on the DL with a left knee strain.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nReds RHP Homer Bailey (0-3, 3.42) will face Cardinals RHP Carlos Martinez (2-1, 1.75) in the second of a three-game series on Saturday. Martinez is 7-3 in his career against Cincinnati and the Cardinals have won seven of his last nine starts against the Reds, including last Sunday's 3-2 win in Cincinnati. Bailey is still looking for his first win in five starts. He is 6-14 in his career against St. Louis.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) \u2014 Sven Andrighetto scored with 1:28 left to give the Colorado Avalanche a 2-1 victory over Nashville Predators 2-1 on Friday night, sending the first-round series back to Denver for Game 6.\n\nThis is the third time the Avalanche had trailed 3-1 in a series since the franchise relocated to Colorado.

Then Andrighetto gave the Avs the lead off a rebound of a shot by J.T.

You keep battling in practice, you stick to the process, when you get your chance, you're ready.\"\n\nThe series winner will face Winnipeg in the second round.\n\nNick Bonino scored for Nashville.\n\nThis game was scoreless until Bonino's goal with 9:42 left, a big change for a series that had been the highest-scoring of the first round averaging 7.25 goals per game coming into Game 5. But the goalie nicknamed the \"Hamburglar\" came through with a dazzling performance for his first postseason victory.\n\nThe Predators peppered the Avs' backup to their backup goalie. The only time Nashville beat Hammond was when Mattias Ekholm's shot bounced off his left pad and went in off Bonino's right skate. The official on the spot immediately waved it off. Officials huddled, then reviewed the play.\n\nDuring the review, fans sang \"Let It Be\" while holding up their cellphones with the flash on. Referee Kevin Pollack announced the call on the ice had been overturned, starting a long-awaited celebration.\n\nThe lead didn't last long as Landeskog tapped the puck into an open net off a feed from Nathan MacKinnon.\n\nThe Avalanche came into the postseason with goalie Semyon Varlamov and defenseman Erik Johnson sidelined by knee injuries, then defenseman Samuel Girard missed three games with his own upper-body injury before Jonathan Bernier, Varlamov's backup, suffered his own lower-body injury. That pushed the Hamburglar into the net.\n\nNashville countered with its usual catfish on the ice before the puck dropped and the members of the NFL's Tennessee Titans secondary waving the rally towel for fans.\n\nThe Predators started and ended the second period on the power play but couldn't beat Hammond. Their best scoring chance came with a 4 on 2, but Hammond stopped Roman Josi's shot and then handled Calle Jarnkrok's attempt off the rebound at 12:36. Hammond also made a big pad save on Ellis' slap shot and then stopped another Josi shot late in the period.\n\nNOTES: The Avalanche snapped a seven-game skid in Nashville with the win. They ended a 12-game skid to the Preds overall in Game 3. ... Nashville had been perfect last postseason with a chance to clinch a series on its own ice, winning all three series to reach the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGame 6 in Denver on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

Bosses at bustling beauty enterprises are, the average story goes, bloodthirsty. Avery, on other hand, is thirsty for an understanding of how normal people \u2015 ones whose grandmothers aren\u2019t the namesake of an imperious brand \u2015 live their lives.\n\nNaturally, that\u2019s something of a struggle for someone whose privilege butts up against her eccentricities. \u201cI thought I smelled animal products,\u201d she meows upon seeing Renee.\n\nIf an actor is fortunate, at some point she\u2019ll give a performance so unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen her do that it\u2019s downright startling. This week, Michelle Williams is that actor. Even though Williams\u2019 first lead in a movie was playing an airheaded teenager who inadvertently exposes Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate break-in in the 1999 satire \u201cDick,\u201d she\u2019s since matured into a so-called serious actress with indie clout and four Oscar nominations to her name \u2015 a fact that makes her bonkers work in \u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d all the more delicious. It\u2019s the type of role that\u2019s only memorable coming from an established performer, especially one known for dramatic heft like \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d\n\nMaybe your jaw will drop as low as mine did upon first hearing Williams speak in \u201cI Feel Pretty,\u201d which opens this weekend. Instead of the velvety innocence that usually accents her on-screen persona, Williams speaks with what co-directors Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein call \u201chigh-pitched vocal fry.\u201d It\u2019s an odd confluence of Valley Girl lilt, enunciated baby-speak and spacey stonerisms, further underscored because the character actually fits none of those attributes. Avery, we learn, has an MBA from Wharton and clerked for a Supreme Court justice before taking a leadership post at Lily LeClair.\n\nSTXfilms Michelle Williams in \"I Feel Pretty.\"\n\nCoupled with the bamboozled but relentlessly relaxed aura Williams brings to the film, Avery\u2019s flat cadence skirts the dragon-lady stereotype that defines the high-powered fashionistas portrayed by Meryl Streep in \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d and Tilda Swinton in \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d She carries herself with the weight of a feather, gliding along as if oblivious to her surroundings at all times.\n\nKohn and SIlverstein, longtime creative partners who also penned \u201cNever Been Kissed\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You,\u201d had written Avery\u2019s intonation into their script, but they had no idea what Williams would do with it until a couple of weeks before she arrived on set. Williams sent Kohn and Silverstein an NPR story from 2015 about a woman incapable of feeling fear. The woman\u2019s speech, which sounds almost identical to the voice Jenny Slate created for the adorable stop-motion creation Marcel the Shell, was Williams\u2019 inspiration, though the results were still a work in progress when she tested it for Kohn and Silverstein over the phone. They didn\u2019t hear the final version until they went to Williams\u2019 trailer on her first day shooting the movie.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, the thing she did for us on the day in the trailer was not like anything we\u2019d talked about before,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cIt was so much better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018Can you sustain it? How is it to do a voice like that?\u2019\u201d Kohn recalled. \u201cShe was like, \u2019Yes, I got it. I can do it. It\u2019s part of the whole thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAvery\u2019s wardrobe completes the \u201cwhole thing.\u201d Costume designer Debra McGuire, who was attracted to \u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d because its empowerment message works in opposition to the \u201ctight, sexy\u201d clothing she felt obligated to use while working on \u201cFriends\u201d in the \u201990s, based Avery\u2019s grandmother (Lauren Hutton) on a cosmetics guru she once knew who dressed head to toe in Chanel. With that in mind, McGuire wanted Avery to put a \u201cfun\u201d twist on high-end fashion, bringing a California ease to the office\u2019s cutthroat New York setting.\n\nSTXfilms Michelle Williams and Amy Schumer in \"I Feel Pretty.\"\n\nFurthermore, Avery and the self-effacing Renee needed to work as complements, not foils \u00e0 la Streep and Anne Hathaway in \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada.\u201d When Renee falls off a SoulCycle bike and knocks her head, her feelings of unworthiness vanish. Convinced she is suddenly thinner and more conventionally beautiful \u2015 \u201cModeling is an option for me,\u201d she later tells Avery and her colleague (Naomi Campbell) \u2015 Renee encounters a series of contrivances that ultimately lead her to realize she got the job (and a boyfriend) without actually shapeshifting or altering her appearance.\n\nNormally, McGuire would have designed Avery\u2019s attire from scratch. But she didn\u2019t have access to Williams during pre-production, as the actress was filming another movie in Europe (presumably \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d which Williams shot in Rome immediately before \u201cPretty\u201d). Instead, McGuire scouted Tom Ford, Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci boutiques. Knowing that Kohn and Silverstein didn\u2019t want Williams to wear the same sort of regalia she dons in real life, McGuire sought an \u201cau current\u201d metropolitan sensibility accentuated by straight, flowing blond locks. \u201cThere was an Ivanka Trump vibe going on there,\u201d she said half-jokingly.\n\nThat dichotomy \u2015 corporate gloss meets puerile squeal \u2015 is best evidenced in a baby-blue dress Avery wears with pink flowers and golden retrievers all over. A Dolce & Gabanna original that McGuire said was inspired by the designers\u2019 own dogs, the blithe garment reflects Avery\u2019s lifelong struggle to cultivate a personality despite the fact that no one takes her seriously. The movie\u2019s producers first balked at the canine frock, thinking it might be too distracting, but McGuire, who had the directors\u2019 support, wasn\u2019t budging. \u201cThat dress was going to be on camera even if I had to stomp over anybody who didn\u2019t want it,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt this was just a perfect place to show part of who this character is because there\u2019s a snobby vibe to the Lily LeClair aesthetic. To come to work in a puppy dress, you\u2019ve gotta be some kind of woman to do that.\u201d\n\nAvery\u2019s accouterments and wispiness mask a crippling insecurity. \u201cI sound like a freaking moron,\u201d she moans in an uncharacteristically candid moment, listing the line items on her astoundingly intellectual biography to prove how belittled she is because of her voice. In the same way that Schumer learns to value her body by the movie\u2019s end, Avery is meant to better understand her place in the class-conscious, image-obsessed world. She is the face of Lily LeClair, but it\u2019s her inability to muster the confidence needed to excel that encourages her to extend the brand to reach more than just snobby rich women. That arc is baked into Williams\u2019 oddities."}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glee-star-kevin-mchale-comes-out-with-a-little-help-from-ariana-grande_us_5ada18a1e4b03c426dae1d4e", "published": "2018-04-20T18:48:48", "title": "'Glee' Star Kevin McHale Comes Out By The Power Of Ariana Grande", "text": "\u201cGlee\u201d star Kevin McHale declared that the newly released Ariana Grande song is \u201cgayer\u201d than he is.\n\nThe actor, who starred on the musical series as Artie Abrams for six seasons, publicly addressed his sexuality for the first time amid rumors that he\u2019s dating actor Austin McKenzie.\n\n\u2033 # NoTearsLeftToCry is gayer than me and I ACCEPT.

She insists he care more about his money and, most importantly, the celebrity that has come along with it. But he doesn\u2019t take her wisdom well and abruptly ends the day by storming out of a nail salon where they\u2019re getting pedicures. The impetus: she snapped a photo of him without asking.\n\nTaryn: Paper Boi. Al. The nigga that kept getting got this episode. Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nJulia: I pray I never have a day as bad as Paper Boi\u2019s Tuesday afternoon was. Don\u2019t ask me how I know it was a Tuesday, I just feel that it was in my spirit.\n\nTaryn: I keep telling folks that Tuesday is the worst day of the week. You could also tell it was Tuesday cause the nail salon wasn\u2019t packed, but we\u2019ll get there in a minute.\n\nJulia: Wow, that\u2019s how I knew it was Tuesday. That empty salon looked familiar.\n\nTaryn: HELLO! I knew I wasn\u2019t alone on that one. This episode was a damn doozy from jump.\n\nJulia: It was. Paper Boi just wanted to hang out with Sierra, an Instagram-famous woman he was considering sleeping with, and it took an ugly turn. But let\u2019s start with him lying on the couch and his mama cussing him out.\n\nTo me, that opening scene of him laying on the couch, sleeping all day, the house is dirty, he\u2019s being short when people ask how he is, etc. \u2015 Paper Boi is depressed. Incredibly so. And I know this because WHEW HAVE I BEEN THERE.\n\nTaryn: That was so triggering. You know how many mornings I\u2019ve woken up to getting cussed out about not cleaning?\n\nAnd that\u2019s a really good point that confirms my belief that his mom really wasn\u2019t there. He was either dreaming or imagining his mom because that\u2019s how she probably used to talk to him in the mornings when he was younger, living with her, when times were simpler and he didn\u2019t have to make these complicated, messy decisions about how he was gonna take control of his life/career.\n\nJulia: I don\u2019t think his mom was really there either. I think she was an apparition \u2015 the first of two this episode, but we\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nTaryn: Oh, we sure will get there. This episode also reminded me of his past interactions at the streaming company and at Clark County\u2019s studio. His primary concern was \u201ckeeping it real\u201d while \u201cbeing all about that paper, boy.\u201d Those two can rarely exist together unless you\u2019re Cardi B, like you told me last night. Sierra tried to tell him that, but he thought she was just blowing smoke. He\u2019s too busy trying to \u201ckeep it real\u201d that he\u2019s removed himself from the reality of how he\u2019s perceived and the direction his career is going.\n\nI was really excited when we saw Sierra. I thought they were about to be my new favorite hood couple when she picked him up in the big boy truck. That\u2019s the hood bitch shit I live for!\n\nJulia: I, too, live for that hood bitch shit. And Sierra, tbh, is the only person we\u2019ve seen this season who gets him and who gets that you can\u2019t keep it real and be famous. Fame, which we got into last episode, is all about the aesthetics and the perception. It\u2019s like ole girl said, \u201cIt\u2019s a simulation, Van. It\u2019s all fake.\u201d\n\nPaper Boi has to understand that very few people are going to care that he\u2019s Al and even less are going to care about his privacy. They care about Paper Boi. Just like people love Cardi B, but they don\u2019t care about Belcalis. (Except us. We care.)\n\nTaryn: We care so much about Belcalis. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSierra was all about helping Paper Boi level up, which in turn, would help her level up. Her comments at the shoe shop about him getting new clothes \u2019cause no one wants to fan over a nigga in a loose-collar ass Polo, telling him he needs a new manager that knows how to make money moves, taking his crusty-toe ass to the nail salon, telling him to post more on IG. Sierra, though imperfect, moves with purpose, something Paper Boi doesn\u2019t give a damn about. (See: Al blowing off Earn telling him to get those papers signed earlier in the episode.) Al thinks he\u2019s about that paper, but Sierra is about that paper.\n\nJulia: Exactly, and to be about the money is to lose a degree of your realness. It just is. Think about black people who infiltrate corporate America. How many of us are actually not gutta af? Black folks in all walks of life have to conform to the demands of white-dominated industries \u2014 at least initially. And, also, Al isn\u2019t as interesting as Paper Boi. He\u2019s not as compelling. He\u2019s just a nigga in a Polo and cargo shorts. Is that fine? Yeah, for somebody who isn\u2019t famous. And it\u2019s like that kid said \u2014 with a mean \u201cwe bout to get this nigga\u201d chuckle \u2014 before they robbed him, \u201cOh, so you keeping it real?\u201d Keeping it real doesn\u2019t get you anything in the public, except robbed twice in one season. Does that say A LOT about our society? Yes. But at the end of the day, GET MONEY BITCH (Khia voice).\n\nTL;DR \u2015 Be real at home.\n\nTaryn: That part. He got so frustrated with Sierra telling him what\u2019s really real about this money game that he ended up on his ass eating Krystal in a parking lot with a broken heart and wet socks. His pride wouldn\u2019t even let him call an Uber cause he was that big mad. Shit, I\u2019d be surprised if Paper Boi even had the app since he wanna be so damn real.\n\nAlso, special shoutout to Sierra for this line: \u201cEverybody wanna be a black girl, but the black girls ain\u2019t making money from it.\u201d\n\nJulia: Give her a fucking Emmy. Another Emmy-winning line: \u201cPermission? Nigga, you famous.\u201d I was shouting, \u201cLET HIM KNOW!\u201d\n\nTaryn: She may be rude af to people with service jobs, but she gets everything else!\n\nJulia: She\u2019s incredibly rude, which ... I don\u2019t understand the relevance of her being rude, but I know for a fact that she had to be rude, because I know women like her and they\u2019re just rude!\n\nTaryn: Yea, I chalked it up to the same thing.\n\nJulia: Yeah, so let\u2019s not get into nail shop politics, when people speak their native language and how black people react. I\u2019ll just say people should be able to speak whatever language they feel most comfortable speaking and Sierra was on 10. And now let\u2019s move on to the Krystal parking lot.\n\nFX NETWORKS\n\nAfter storming out of the nail salon, Paper Boi stops at Krystal \u2014 a Southern staple \u2014 to grab a burger. He gets a text from an unsaved number saying they\u2019re thinking about him, another check-in he shrugs off. He continues on his walk home and encounters three teens who are discussing the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie. Their demeanor is a little odd. They don\u2019t seem genuinely enthused to see Paper Boi \u2014 which differs vastly from other encounters with fans this season \u2014 and the scene feels as though the trio were waiting on his arrival. They inquire why he\u2019s alone with no car and Al, nervously, counters with his own question of whether he\u2019s allowed to walk. The teens inch closer to him with one saying through a cartoonish smile, in an unprovoked reference to his conversation with Sierra, \u201cOh, you keeping it real? That\u2019s what\u2019s up!\u201d They slowly surround him, smiling, before one throws ice in his face as the other sucker punches him and the third pulls out a gun. The rapper fights off the kids who make off with his watch and his chain. He headbutts the one holding the gun before dashing into the woods to avoid getting shot.\n\nJulia: Have you ever had a Krystal burger? They so good that one time, when I was visiting my parents in Georgia, me and my stepdad went and didn\u2019t tell my mom. And she KIRKED. We tried to sneak the bag in the house but it didn\u2019t work. We got busted.\n\nTaryn: See. Y\u2019all wrong af for that. You know Krystal is too damn good.\n\nJulia: She should\u2019ve rode out with us! We asked her if she wanted anything. She said no, so we assumed that meant Krystal as well.\n\nBut after he had his Krystal burger, Paper Boi kept walking and ran into some teenagers. And got his watch snatched. And his chain. And he almost got shot. Like you said last night, this is when keeping it real went wrong.\n\nI also think Sierra set him up.\n\nTaryn: Do tell. \ud83d\udc41\n\nJulia: So, this is my conspiracy theory. When Paper Boi walks up on the trio of teens, something about it feels off. It\u2019s like they aren\u2019t genuinely excited to see him as his fans usually are. Their body language is weird and they\u2019re talking like bad actors, like they rehearsed this or something. It wasn\u2019t a natural encounter. But the tip was when ole boy with the gun says, \u201cOh, you keeping it real?\u201d completely unprovoked. How would he know that Paper Boi walking was an attempt to keep it real, which is what he told Sierra basically, if she didn\u2019t set him up?! And it\u2019s not like she wasn\u2019t acting cartoonish herself throughout their day.\n\n\n\nOr, alternatively, when the other teen said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell my brother about this!\u201d maybe his brother recognized dickhead out walking alone and tipped them off. Either way, SOMEBODY SET HIM UP!\n\nTaryn: Yea, their behavior definitely felt off from jump. I just wonder if it was Sierra\u2019s doing or not. I\u2019m leaning toward his brother \u2015 or someone else \u2015 but I wouldn\u2019t put it past Sierra cause she\u2019s strategic as hell. I also think he might\u2019ve said, \u201cOh, you keeping it real?\u201d on his own just thinking about the Glover brothers\u2019 method of threading things together by way of repetition via different vessels. Like the humming from his mom, then late, from the old man. Or Teddy Perkins slamming his hand on the piano as his father did in the home video a couple episodes ago. Might be a reach, but I feel like they might be making a larger point about what happens when you don\u2019t listen to the universe. Facing fucked-up shit is cyclical and not always from the same source.\n\nJulia: That makes more sense than my conspiracy.\n\n\n\nTaryn: LMAO I have a deep appreciation for a good conspiracy theory, though.\n\n\n\nJulia: Thank you. I feel seen.\n\nTaryn: But that young boy saying, \u201cOh you keeping it real? That\u2019s what\u2019s up.\u201d was like him saying \u201cBet, you just like any other nigga? So we bout to rob your ass as soon as the Marta passes.\u201d Though I\u2019ve never gotten robbed at gunpoint as the train goes by, the scene felt so familiar, and so triggering. My heart rate was UP.\n\nJulia: When they asked if he was by himself I knew he was about to get robbed at gunpoint. But Paper Boi, in true real nigga form, grabbed the gun. I was impressed tbh because I just would\u2019ve ran them my shit. I\u2019m not dying over a chain, a phone, money. Nah.\n\n\u201cGive me your phone.\u201d hands over phone, which is the bane of my existence anyway so thanks for the favor lowkey, don\u2019t shoot me.\n\nI\u2019m gonna get a new iPhone next year anyway so Midas Whale just turn it over. Shoutout to the upgrade-every-year plan.\n\nTaryn: CHILE! Stressing me OUT. That struggle with the gun had me shook. I guess I get it cause he\u2019d been robbed earlier in the season and he\u2019s a big nigga so maybe he thought he could take them on. It just wouldn\u2019t have been me. Then I couldn\u2019t take him running into the woods for his life. And we begin to see this recurring horror trope this season has been fond of using.\n\nJulia: Him grabbing the gun, to me, was symbolic of his priorities. Paper Boi cares deeply about respect (as many ppl from the hood do because it\u2019s understood that disrespecting someone can get you hurt). He cared enough about his chain, his watch and his pride to grab the gun, headbutt the kid, then go looking for them once he collected himself in the woods. But he doesn\u2019t care enough to do what\u2019s required to protect himself and his fame and prevent this from happening? He doesn\u2019t care enough to accept that this will keep happening unless he levels up and accepts the perceptions of him and his fame? OK, Paper Boi. You got it, sis.\n\nAnd the horror trope. They are really killing it. it\u2019s such an effective way to explore the mind states of black Americans.\n\nTaryn: HELLO! Also, when I saw this episode was entitled \u201cWoods,\u201d I surely thought it was gonna be about Backwoods. That\u2019s the black in me, though.\n\nJulia: I\u2019m honestly speechless, Taryn. But, never change.\n\nTaryn: I wouldn\u2019t have been keeping it real if I didn\u2019t admit that.\n\nJulia: ljhsDGFDEFCJDSHFC. Can someone sucker-punch me? I\u2019m so fed up. I\u2019ll just hand over my phone.\n\nTaryn: Unlike Al, however, I know how real to keep it while still getting to this check. And THAT\u2019S what\u2019s really real.\n\nSCREENSHOT\n\nJulia: I love that meme of Rihanna so much it hurts.\n\nTaryn: Girl, you know it stays on deck in this here iPhone.\n\nFX NETWORKS\n\nIn the woods, Paper Boi encounters an old man humming a gospel tune. The old man could be homeless, lost or a figment of Al\u2019s imagination. Al tells the guy that he\u2019s just passing through and he doesn\u2019t want any trouble. But the old man follows Al through the woods, taunting him, asking him if he wants some money or some ChapStick and, at one point, apologizing for being high. In one instance, Al grabs the old man and tells him to back off, to which the man responds with a deep look of concern in his eyes, \u201cYou is just like your mama.\u201d Fear invades Al\u2019s face leaving us to wonder if he knows this old man from somewhere \u2014 or if it\u2019s a clear nod to the old man\u2019s status as an apparition \u2014 though the old man just laughs it off. Eventually, Al takes a seat and says he needs a moment to think. The old man tells Al that thinking is an impossible task causing Al to lash out and ask, again, to be left the fuck alone. The old man, baffled at the disrespect, puts a box cutter to Al\u2019s neck, delivers a mean word of wisdom about making critical decisions and gives Al 30 seconds to get out of the woods before he hurts the rapper.\n\nTaryn: That old man was the realest character in this episode, tbh. We\u2019re introduced to him by his humming at first. I didn\u2019t get the significance of the negro spiritual hum until I went back and rewatched it and saw that Al\u2019s mom was humming in the opening scene. The man in the woods represented so much: his mom\u2019s wisdom, the guiding light necessary for his internal conflict and his mental health.\n\nI\u2019d even argue that he represents the ancestors. We see the dead deer (another \u201cGet Out\u201d reference) that wasn\u2019t able to make it out of the woods for whatever reason. If Al wants to survive, he has to learn from those who came before him and stop being so damn stubborn, like the old man told him.\n\nJulia: The humming of the same (or at least similar) tune is what led me to believe the old man was an apparition along with a mumbled line from him I missed on my first watch: \u201cDon\u2019t think you can out-slip me.\u201d He represented Al\u2019s internal conflict with accepting his fame just like the woods represented the direness of this transitional moment Al is in. And when Al passed the dead deer again, I realized that he was walking in circles \u2014 just like he was in his life \u2014 and that refusal to push forward out of the woods would kill him one way or another.\n\nI found this line really telling as well: \u201cMake the decision. Keep standing still, you gone boy. You wasting time and the only people who got time are dead. And if you dead, I\u2019m gon\u2019 take them shoes. And your wallet. And that shirt.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact that Al ran straight out of the woods once the man started his countdown tells me that the answer was always straight in front of him. No circles required.\n\nTaryn: Yes! Literally lost and he didn\u2019t know it until that point. My mom always says that the answers are always in front of you, you just gotta stop being so damn stubborn and see it. It took a long day of getting dumped, robbed at gunpoint, lost in the woods and almost getting his throat slit to get him to realize it, but he finally did. He finally made \u201cthe decision\u201d that I\u2019m sure had been lingering in his head for forever. He just chose to ignore it. He finds himself in the gas station and runs into a fan who recognizes him. He asks if he wants a selfie and, alas, we have the awakening of Paper Boi.\n\nI just wonder a) when he\u2019s gonna try to get back with Sierra and b) when he\u2019s gonna fire Earn and get a new manager.\n\nJulia: Yes. He finally accepts that Al and Paper Boi are the same nigga. And, oh yeah, this episode confirmed that he is absolutely going to fire Earn. He can\u2019t be Paper Boi and have Earn as his manager. Earn is Al\u2019s manager.\n\nTaryn: Exactly! I just hope he doesn\u2019t switch up on Darius. I also hope that after this long-ass day, Darius saved him some of that toe jam tortellini he made cause I know that burger didn\u2019t hold him over burning all them calories in the woods all day.\n\nJulia: Nah that lil Krystal burger gone.\n\nTaryn: Also, I wanna give another special shoutout to the old man in the woods for humming the \u201cGolden Girls\u201d theme song while drinking a Mad Dog. And for offering Paper Boi ChapStick but telling him not to put his lips on it. Those moments made me smile through the stress.\n\nJulia: My granddaddy used to drink Mad Dog, the red one, which was incredibly comforting.\n\nOne last thing. I read in Vulture that all the older black men this season have been ghosts in some way: \u201cGhosts of themselves, as with Teddy Perkins. Ghosts of their children, as with Darius. Ghosts of what they could\u2019ve been, as Earn notes of his uncle. And now, Al has come into contact with his own ghost \u2014 although what he\u2019s a conduit for, specifically, no one can say. All we know for certain is that Al wants nothing to do with him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s kind of wild that everyone this season is dealing with a ghost. Something is following all of them and I\u2019m interested to see how this all ties together in the end (or if it does).\n\nTaryn: Wow. That makes so much sense. The same thing that you let haunt you will rob you if you don\u2019t take control. Everyone is looking for that control, but no one really knows how to achieve it because they haven\u2019t addressed what\u2019s haunting them. Shit, that blows my mind.\n\nJulia: The gag is that that\u2019s life. Real or fake, that\u2019s life."}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-dead-nicaragua-clashes_us_5ada893ce4b009869bf97282", "published": "2018-04-21T03:17:32", "title": "At Least 3 Dead In Violent Clashes In Nicaragua Over Social Security Cuts", "text": "Two young protesters and a police officer were killed in increasingly violent clashes over social security cuts in Nicaragua, Reuters reported Friday.\n\nProtests began Wednesday after a new law was signed increasing worker tax contributions and cutting pension income from the nation\u2019s social security system. Some demonstrations began peacefully, with protesters waving placards and chanting, \u201cViva Nicaragua libre!\u201d (\u201cLong live a free Nicaragua!\u201d)\n\nBut in some areas, pro-government forces clashed with protesters, police lobbed tear gas from behind shields and buildings were set afire. A police officer and protester were fatally shot on Thursday in Nicaragua\u2019s capital, Managua, where thousands took to the streets, and another protester was shot dead in Tipitapa, northeast of the capital, the Red Cross told Reuters.\n\nOne eyewitness reported on Twitter that five buildings, among them the National Lottery in Le\u00f3n and the student center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, were burning Friday afternoon. Protests had reportedly spread to at least 10 cities.\n\nLisseth Guido, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross of Nicaragua, told Reuters on Friday that 48 people were treated for various injuries.\n\nThe government shut down most main news sources other than La Prensa, protester Yolaina Vargas Pritchard told HuffPost. La Prensa was reporting that police were switching from rubber bullets to live ammunition.\n\nVargas Pritchard, 27, who works for a local nongovernmental organization, said that, although the demonstrations began peacefully, violence erupted in clashes with pro-government protesters and security forces.

Such inspections, noted The New York Times, can \u201cdetect flaws or cracks not visible to the unaided human eye.\u201d\n\nManufactured by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric and France\u2019s Safra Aircraft Engines, the CFM56-7B is one of the most widely used jet engines. The FAA said its directive would affect more than 350 engines in the U.S. and hundreds more worldwide.\n\n#FAA Statement (4/4): The EAD https://t.co/NTqXpA3PY4 becomes effective upon publication. The engine manufacturer estimates today\u2019s corrective action affects 352 engines in the U.S. and 681 engines worldwide.\n\n\n\nFull FAA statement available at https://t.co/CfDPmo5EOT. \u2014 The FAA (@FAANews) April 20, 2018\n\nThe emergency order comes amid increased scrutiny of engine inspection processes following the death of a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas on Tuesday.\n\nJennifer Riordan, 43, was partially sucked out of the Southwest plane when the Boeing 737-700\u2019s engine exploded mid-flight and its debris smashed a window. Riordan died at a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Philadelphia. Several other passengers were injured in the ordeal.\n\nThe chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Robert Sumwalt, said on Wednesday that the engine had blown up after one of its blades had broken in two places.\n\nThe cause of the engine failure is still being investigated by the NTSB, but metal fatigue \u2015 which can cause cracks and other weaknesses that are not visible to the naked eye \u2015 has been suspected as a factor.\n\nOn the Sunday before the accident, a visual inspection of the engine had found no issues with it. Sumwalt said the cracks in the engine blade were \u201cmore than likely not detectable from looking from the outside,\u201d reported the Times.\n\nOn Friday, the FAA said it was mandating inspections of certain engine blades after determining that the problem of cracks arising from metal fatigue \u201cis likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.\u201d\n\nThe agency said it had based its directive on a bulletin issued earlier in the day by CFM International, which recommended airlines carry out prompt ultrasonic inspections on fan blades on certain CFM56-7B engines.\n\nBloomberg noted that such inspections can be carried out without having to dismantle the engine and can be completed within about four hours per engine.\n\nIn conjunction with the planned Emergency AD from FAA, CFM has released its updated service bulletin to airlines. The CFM56-7B blade inspection criteria, as expected, adds total cycles, not just cycles since last shop visit. #WN1380 pic.twitter.com/uqrQ9iptHb \u2014 Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) April 20, 2018\n\nCFM International had issued a similar recommendation in 2016 after the failure of a CFM56-7B engine on another Southwest aircraft. An investigation into that incident is still underway, but the NTSB said it had also found evidence of metal fatigue.\n\nSouthwest had initially pushed back against CFM International\u2019s recommendation that inspections be completed within 12 months and had asked for more time last year, reported The Associated Press. The airline eventually did begin conducting inspections of certain engine fan blades. A spokeswoman told AP that the airline had already inspected about half of the engine blades identified by the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation before this week\u2019s accident.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Southwest said its existing maintenance program \u201cmeets or exceeds all the requirements specified\u201d in the FAA\u2019s new order.\n\nSeveral other domestic airlines, including Delta and American, also began inspections of certain engine fan blades last year following the 2016 incident, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThough aircraft engine failures are very rare and the CFM56-7B engine has an otherwise excellent safety record, the two apparently similar engine failures have left some aviation experts concerned.\n\nJohn Gadzinski, president of Four Winds Aerospace Safety, an aviation consultant, told HuffPost on Friday that the failures suggest that there could be a design flaw with the engine or something fundamentally wrong with the engine certification process.\n\n\u201cThere are very specific regulation guidelines to ensure that if an engine does fail, that it doesn\u2019t come apart and turn into little bombs. The housing of the engine is supposed to contain these fan blade failures,\u201d Gadzinski said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a fairly big deal for this kind of failure to happen.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/famed-dj-avicii-dies-at-28-years-old_us_5ada2353e4b00a1849cf06be", "published": "2018-04-20T17:38:03", "title": "Famed DJ Avicii Dies At 28", "text": "Swedish DJ, artist, and producer Tim Bergling, better known as Avicii, has died at the age of 28.\n\n\u201cIt is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,\u201d reads a statement from his representatives.\n\nHe was found dead in Muscat, Oman, on Friday afternoon local time, the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time.

Five weeks into the trial, jurors deliberated for less than a full day before finding Kansas militiamen Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright guilty on all charges.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the trio on trial.\n\nSo too was Dan Day, the FBI informant whose hours of recordings \u2015 which featured vile discussions of planned violence against Muslims, who the men called \u201ccockroaches\u201d \u2015 were the centerpiece of the federal government\u2019s case against a group that dubbed themselves \u201cThe Crusaders.\u201d\n\nDay\u2019s testimony was at the center of the trial. Federal prosecutors would not have had a case without him. Defense attorneys said the plot would never have moved forward if it was not for Day pushing the group to action.\n\nThe two sides offered up competing portraits of the 49-year-old Day in court. The government portrayed him as an \u201ceveryday guy,\u201d a patriot and a hero who risked his life and stepped up to prevent a looming attack that would have killed countless men, women and children because of their faith, race and national origin. Defense attorneys said Day was an unemployed wannabe who jumped at the chance to become an undercover FBI informant and was willing to do whatever the federal government needed for a check.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with HuffPost, Day said it\u2019s a relief to put this experience behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard to believe this actually happened,\u201d he said. He\u2019s glad \u201cjustice was served\u201d in the case, and thinks divine intervention led to his involvement, he added.\n\n\u201cI felt like it was a calling from God, honestly,\u201d Day said of taking the risk of becoming an informant. \u201cI\u2019m not an over-religious person, but I believe in God and I believe he put me there at the right time, the right place, if that makes any sense.\u201d\n\nThe father of two high school-age children and the youngest of 14 kids, Day grew up in Garden City, Kansas, home to the apartment complex the defendants ultimately targeted. Up until a few years ago, he worked as a probation officer and in juvenile detention before that.\n\nHis path to becoming an informant for the FBI is completely unique.\n\nIt began in July of 2015 with a trip to the local library with his son. He saw what he considered an anti-Israel poster, which featured a Palestinian flag and described the situation in Israel as apartheid. He tore it down.\n\n\u201cThey have the right to put that up, and I have the right to take that down, in my opinion, so I did,\u201d Day said of the incident.\n\nThen he passed along a photo of the poster to a friend who eventually posted about it on Facebook. The post went viral.\n\nI\u2019m no hero, man, believe me. I\u2019m not a perfect person, but I\u2019m truthful. FBI informant Dan Day\n\nDay was soon invited to a cookout attended by a number of members of a militia group in Kansas. Somewhere along the line the story got mixed up, and people in the militia believed that Day had found an ISIS recruiting poster. That wasn\u2019t the case at all.\n\nBut the FBI, which was looking into rumors of the ISIS poster, interviewed Day and ended up being interested in him because of his connection to the militia. It wasn\u2019t long before Day was working on the bureau\u2019s behalf, giving the federal government an inside look at the larger militia group.\n\nThen Day met the defendants. The difference between them and the larger group, federal prosecutors said, was that the defendants weren\u2019t just talking \u2015 they were ready to take action.\n\nKansas-based Assistant U.S. Attorney Tony Mattivi, who prosecuted the case alongside two prosecutors from the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, told jurors that Day was an \u201caverage guy\u201d who stepped up at the right moment to stop men who wanted to \u201cblow up a bomb, flatten the building and murder every single man, woman and child inside.\u201d\n\nDay could have walked away, like the other members of the larger militia group who knew a plan was in motion but did nothing to stop it, Mattivi said. \u201cThat guy\u2019s a patriot. He\u2019s a hero,\u201d he added.\n\nDefense attorneys saw it differently. They accused the federal government of overreaching and said the case wouldn\u2019t have gone anywhere if it hadn\u2019t been for Day\u2019s involvement. They frequently mentioned that Day was working for the FBI before he ever came into contact with the defendants.\n\n\u201cThe FBI owns Dan Day and they own the words that he said,\u201d argued Melody Brannon, the top federal public defender in Kansas who was representing Allen.\n\nRyan J. Reilly/HuffPost FBI Kansas City Division Acting Special Agent in Charge Shelly Doherty, U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister and Assistant US Attorney Tony Mattivi at a press conference following the guilty verdict.\n\nDay said the defense\u2019s attacks on him were unfair and only happened because defense attorneys couldn\u2019t dispute what the defendants said in the tapes he recorded. \u201cThey had to attack me, and they had to attack the FBI,\u201d he said. \u201cI put my whole life out there so they could knock me down.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Day said he was also uncomfortable with the prosecution\u2019s glowing depiction of his role. \u201cI\u2019m no hero, man, believe me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a perfect person, but I\u2019m truthful.\u201d\n\nWorking in remote areas of Kansas, there was no backup team standing by when Day attended meetings with the militiamen. He had a phone that was constantly recording in the background that even he couldn\u2019t turn off.\n\nIt was scary at times, Day said. He noted he was armed, and \u201cwould\u2019ve did what [he] had to do\u201d if he was discovered.\n\nBeing undercover, observing and participating as the men spewed Islamophobic rhetoric, Day said the defense attorneys and the media overplayed the influence that President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim remarks had on the defendants. He called it a \u201cTrump card\u201d used as an excuse for the militia\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThese guys had a hate in their heart towards all Muslims, long before Trump came along in the picture,\u201d said Day, who described himself as \u201canti-Hillary\u201d and said he would have voted for Trump had he not been preoccupied with the case right before the 2016 election.\n\nStill, Day said he would have liked Trump to have toned down some of his more extreme rhetoric about Muslims.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump should not have ever said those things. I don\u2019t agree with him saying that, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cRegular Muslims, if they come over and they\u2019re vetted, that\u2019s our country, man. That\u2019s a free country. That\u2019s how my grandparents got here.\u201d\n\nREUTERS/Adam Shrimplin\n\nDay, like a lot of Americans, said he personally hasn\u2019t had much interaction with Muslims. He said he had concerns about radical Islam, but said he \u201cnever had a bad view\u201d of Muslims as a whole.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s rare for the federal government to deploy informants and undercover officers in terrorism stings against non-Muslim defendants. The Intercept\u2019s Trial and Terror project identified 310 terrorism sting operations that involved international terrorism, meaning groups like the self-described Islamic State.\n\nMost of the high-profile cases typically involved young Muslim men who became the focus of FBI investigations because of what they\u2019d written online. Those cases primarily resulted in material support charges unavailable in cases against domestic extremists.\n\nDay said he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s next for him. As defense attorneys noted, he\u2019ll probably get a conviction bonus from the FBI for his work on the case, in addition to the more than $30,000 he has already received. He would\u2019ve made more money working a regular job, he said, and he\u2019ll start looking for one soon.\n\n\n\nHe said he found some of the defense\u2019s comments in closing arguments to be laughable. Stein was compared to a \u201cchild playing at war\u201d who had a \u201cwillingness to believe the fantastical\u201d and an \u201cinflated sense of self.\u201d Wright was portrayed as someone who just wanted to fit in and thought Day was his friend.\n\nDay said it was particularly ridiculous that Wright\u2019s attorney brought up the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 divorce more than 35 years ago, when Wright was 14.\n\n\u201cCome on, man,\u201d Day said. \u201cGive him a puppy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDay added that he doesn\u2019t want to sound like he\u2019s overly happy about what happened to the defendants and that he\u2019s particularly conscious of the effect their convictions will have on their families. But he doesn\u2019t have much sympathy for the defendants themselves, who he said had plenty of opportunities to back away from the plot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell them fuck off,\u201d Day said. \u201cThey made their choices.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-sexual-harassment-bill_us_5ad6459ce4b0edca2cbea90d", "published": "2018-04-20T21:59:22", "title": "Congress Still Hasn't Dealt With Its Sexual Harassment Problem", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Two months ago, it looked like Congress was ready to crack down on its embarrassing problems with sexual harassment.\n\nThat\u2019s when the House passed a bill to overhaul the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. Support for the bill was a no-brainer \u2015 it passed unanimously, on a voice vote \u2015 and it made badly needed updates, like banning sexual relationships between members of Congress and their staffers. It also eliminates a requirement that House staffers go through a 30-day counseling and mediation period before filing a workplace complaint.\n\nBut the bill has gone nowhere in the Senate since February, and nobody can say when or if similar legislation will move forward. The reason? Some senators don\u2019t like the bill\u2019s requirement that they would have to pay out of pocket if they are found personally liable for harassing or discriminating against employees.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who chairs the rules committee and is involved in negotiations on the bill, said Tuesday that the panel is \u201ctrying to come to a conclusion\u201d on the bill.\n\nAsked why it\u2019s been so delayed, he carefully considered his words. \u201cI think anytime you\u2019re dealing with members\u2019 personal liability, you ought to be sure that the members understand what they\u2019re asked to vote on,\u201d he said.\n\nIt speaks volumes about the Senate that it\u2019s struggling to pass a bill to make it easier for Capitol Hill victims of sexual harassment or discrimination to file a complaint \u2015 and that it\u2019s because anonymous senators don\u2019t want to have to personally pay for misconduct claims when they are found liable.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s inaction comes after a string of lawmakers resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct, including Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) said in January that he won\u2019t seek re-election after a former female aide said he lashed out at her after she rejected his romantic advances. Meehan called the aide his \u201csoul mate.\u201d\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) resigned in April amid allegations of sexual harassment and after he spent $84,000 in taxpayer money to settle a lawsuit against him.\n\nCongress clearly needs to deal with this. Four out of 10 female congressional aides believe sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill, according to a 2016 CQ Roll Call survey. The same survey found that 1 in 6 said they had been personally victimized.\n\nSupporters of the Hill harassment bill thought the Senate would just tuck it into last month\u2019s must-pass omnibus spending package and be done with it. But according to two senior Democratic aides familiar with negotiations on that package, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to roll the harassment bill into it unless they stripped out its provision requiring lawmakers to be personally liable.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to do that in order to put it into the omnibus,\u201d said one of the aides. \u201cBut [House Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi and [California Democratic Rep. Jackie] Speier objected to the change.\u201d\n\nMcConnell spokesman Don Stewart denied that it was McConnell himself who had problems with that provision. He pointed to a statement previously issued by another McConnell spokesman, David Popp, who said, \u201cSen. McConnell supports members being personally, financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have engaged.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who, exactly, is opposed to this provision. But the Senate\u2019s inaction is infuriating lawmakers in both parties who believe this should not be difficult.\n\nStop giving us lip service and pass the bill. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\n\nLast month, all 22 female senators of both parties ripped McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for not making the bill a priority. On Thursday, every Democratic senator \u2015 plus Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who co-authored the Senate\u2019s version of the harassment bill \u2015 wrote to McConnell demanding action on the issue.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), who is the ranking Democrat on the rules committee and involved in negotiations on the bill, expressed optimism that senators would get some version of the bill out the door.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to push on this,\u201d Klobuchar told HuffPost this week. \u201cThe letter that we had with all the women senators \u2026 I think that was really significant. Let\u2019s just say, it got noticed.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s hopeful a bill will be ready \u201cin the next month or two.\u201d\n\nBut the longer this bill hangs out there, the less clear it becomes what must-pass bill it can be attached to. And as it gets closer to the November elections, action in the Senate will significantly slow down. That could mean the bill gets delayed even further, or possibly lost in the shuffle of other matters.\n\nSpeier, the sponsor of the House bill, said if McConnell truly supports lawmakers having to pay out of pocket when they harass or discriminate against their staff, it makes no sense why he won\u2019t give her bill a vote now."}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/comey-memos-wildest-revelations_us_5ad9c15ae4b029ebe0231c0a", "published": "2018-04-20T12:01:56", "title": "5 Of The Wildest Revelations In The Comey Memos", "text": "The memos of former FBI Director James Comey released to congressional leaders provide a trove of insight into President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities and concerns.\n\nThey reinforce Trump\u2019s widely reported obsession with pinning down leakers, his desire to protect his own reputation at all costs, and his preoccupation with loyalty.

The case raises a potential red flag for the federal agency that has already been dogged by several controversies during the Trump administration.\n\nAccording to the ethics agreement Bernhardt signed on May 1, 2017, he is prohibited from participating in matters involving his previous employer, the lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber & Schreck. But according to Bernhardt\u2019s calendar, Bernhardt met last October with Gale Norton, the former Interior Secretary under George W. Bush who now runs her own lobbying shop, Norton Regulatory Strategies. At the time of the meeting, Norton registered to lobby the Interior Department on behalf of a single client: MGM.\n\nBoth Norton and Bernhardt denied discussing MGM, telling HuffPost that the meeting was merely a \u201csocial visit.\u201d Associate Deputy Secretary James Cason and Assistant Secretary of Insular Areas Doug Domenech were also present for the meeting.\n\nLobbying records show that not only was Norton registered to lobby interior for just one client, she was also lobbying on just one issue \u2015 MGM\u2019s opposition to a proposed casino partnership between two Connecticut native tribes, Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan, which MGM views as a competitor.\n\nSince the tribes are proposing an off-reservation casino, they require approval from the Department of Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs. MGM hired Norton as part of a year-long lobbying blitz against federal approval of the East Windsor, Connecticut, casino, just 13 miles across the border from MGM\u2019s casino in Springfield, Massachusetts. Brownstein Hyatt has represented MGM on the matter since at least March 2017, when Bernhardt headed the firm\u2019s energy, environment and resources team.\n\nThe lobbying campaign seems to have been a success for MGM thus far, as the Interior Department has stalled on authorizing the casino. The two tribes have filed a lawsuit in federal court to try to force the Interior Department to make a decision on the application.\n\nThe excuse that the meeting was merely a social visit is not very credible, given that it was an official meeting on government time and on government premises. Craig Holman, Public Citizen.\n\nYet both Norton and Bernhardt deny they talked about the casino in their October meeting. Norton told HuffPost via email she met Bernhardt at the Interior Department\u2019s headquarters \u201cwhile I was in DC for other reasons.\u201d\n\nFaith Vander Voort, an Interior Department spokeswoman, said Bernhardt \u201ccompletely rejects the false implication regarding the discussion of any issues pending before the Department of the Interior with Secretary Norton.\u201d\n\nVander Voort said Bernhardt is following his ethics agreement recusals and has not participated in any particular matter involving specific parties where his former clients are a party or where his former firm represents a party in such matter.\n\n\u201cThe former secretary was dropping by to catch up with the deputy secretary and a few other of her former staff who have returned to the Department of the Interior,\u201d said Vander Voort. \u201cMr. Bernhardt has and had no idea that she had any business before the Department of the Interior and she never mentioned any such matters to him.\u201d\n\nThe case concerns ethics experts, however. \u201cThe excuse that the meeting was merely a social visit is not very credible, given that it was an official meeting on government time and on government premises,\u201d said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for the watchdog group Public Citizen. \u201cIt seems highly likely that the meeting was about MGM, which would run afoul again of Bernhardt\u2019s ethical obligations under his signed ethics agreement.\u201d\n\nThe Western Values Project, a public lands advocacy group, also drew attention to issues currently before the Interior Department involving Brownstein Hyatt\u2019s clients, noting there are no special ethics waivers on file at the Interior Department permitting Bernhardt to work on these matters. This, despite a memo he recently circulated to Interior Department staff that WVP obtained, announcing new ethics initiatives aimed at preventing employees from \u201cmaking decisions that [are] unethical and in some cases illegal.\u201d\n\nNorton and Bernhardt have known each other for nearly two decades. Both were partners at Brownstein Hyatt in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and Bernhardt served as deputy chief of staff to Norton when she was secretary of the interior. Norton once referred to Bernhardt as \u201cone of my most trusted advisers.\u201d\n\nAround the time Bernhardt met with Norton at interior\u2019s headquarters last October, his former colleagues at Brownstein Hyatt also had several meetings and phone calls with Bernhardt\u2019s associate deputy secretary, James Cason. Cason\u2019s calendar indicates he met in June with \u201cMGM representatives\u201d regarding the casino, then had three phone calls and a meeting in December and January with Brownstein Hyatt\u2019s Larry Jensen, who represents MGM on the casino matter.\n\nBernhardt and Jensen also go back a long way. Jensen was Bernhardt\u2019s deputy when the latter was the Interior Department\u2019s solicitor in the mid-2000s. Afterward, they worked together on Brownstein Hyatt\u2019s energy, environment and resource team.\n\nPublic Citizen filed a complaint with the Department of Interior\u2019s Ethics Office last month, arguing that Bernhardt is still overseeing issues he lobbied on within two years of his appointment as deputy secretary, an apparent violation of President Donald Trump\u2019s own ethics executive order.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018\n\n\u201cThis can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails,\u201d Trump, a Republican, wrote.\n\nTrump appeared to refer to Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who chaired the DNC during the election when its servers were hacked, and a Pakistan-born information technology worker found by the House of Representatives inspector general to have inappropriately accessed congressional data.\n\nThe campaign operation Trump has already set up ahead of the 2020 president election called the lawsuit frivolous and characterized it as a fundraising effort.\n\n\u201cThis is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,\u201d the campaign\u2019s manager, Brad Parscale, said in a statement.\n\nDefendants in the lawsuit include three people who have been indicted as a result of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling: former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Manafort associate Rick Gates and former campaign aide George Papadopoulos.\n\nAlso named as defendants were Donald Trump Jr., Trump associate Roger Stone and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied his campaign colluded with Russia and Moscow has denied meddling in the election.\n\nFour U.S. intelligence agencies reported last year that Russia sponsored the hacking of Democratic Party groups and other actions during the 2016 campaign. Part of the effort was to benefit Trump over Clinton, the agencies said.\n\nThe DNC blames Russia for breaches of its computer systems in 2015 and the first half of 2016.\n\nHackers disseminated internal communications of party officials as the Democratic nominating convention began and WikiLeaks released thousands of emails, some of which were embarrassing for the Clinton campaign and were intended to stoke conflicts among the party\u2019s supporters.\n\nMost of the accusations appeared to be based on news reports and publicly available legal documents and offered little new information about alleged collusion with Moscow.\n\nMIDTERM EFFECT\n\nDemocrats are keen to remind voters of the issue of Russia and the 2016 election ahead of November\u2019s midterm congressional elections. Early polls show Republicans run some risk of losing control of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe suit gives Democrats a useful and perhaps compelling narrative to counter the president\u2019s and Republicans\u2019 mantra of \u2018no collusion,\u2019\u201d said Leonard Williams, a political science professor at Manchester University. \u201cFrom that partisan standpoint, it is exactly what their candidates and spokespeople need.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks, and attorneys for Trump Jr., Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulos also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nStone said the lawsuit was based on \u201ca left-wing conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO proof or evidence,\u201d he wrote in an email to Reuters.\n\nThe lawsuit, should it go forward, seems likely to help keep the spotlight on the issue of Russian election interference and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. Both are being investigated by Mueller, whose office declined to comment on the Democratic lawsuit.\n\nThrough the process of legal discovery, lawyers for the Democratic Party could force the defendants to produce documents they say relate to the collusion issue.\n\nThe lawsuit \u201cmight not have any journalistic, judicial, or political staying power,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cWhether it amounts to more than a story to tell remains to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might lead to additional discovery of events and relationships that we don\u2019t yet know about.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/los-angeles-times-class-action-lawsuit_us_5ada51d7e4b00a1849cf3c02", "published": "2018-04-20T23:06:49", "title": "LA Times Union Preparing Class-Action Lawsuit Over 'Illegal Pay Disparities'", "text": "Colleagues,\n\nIn the wake of our pay equity study, many of you have expressed concerns that you are a victim of pay discrimination under the California Fair Pay Act. Many of you have asked for both individual guidance on how to proceed as well as a plan of action from the Los Angeles Times Guild to rapidly address these illegal pay disparities.\n\nWe held an open meeting with our attorney and our Guild representative on Wednesday, and settled on the following plan of action:\n\n1. Bargaining\n\nThe L.A. Times Guild has asked the company to bargain over the issue. Our goal is to quickly achieve raises and seek back pay for affected employees. We sent that request to bargain earlier today, which you can find attached to this email.\n\nTo be clear: this will be a separate track from our negotiations over our main collective bargaining agreement, which we have not yet begun because of the pending sale of the paper.\n\nOur immediate concern is fully addressing illegal pay disparities on an individual basis. Contract proposals to help prevent this problem from recurring (such as pay minimums or step increases) will come later. The Diversity & Equity committee ... will be in touch about those proposals.\n\n2. Legal action\n\nWe are preparing a class action lawsuit, as a second option, with assistance from the law firm that also represents the Guild. The potential class action would be filed by a named plaintiff or plaintiffs in coordination with the Guild\u2019s efforts to get the company to negotiate a timely and satisfactory agreement to address pay disparities. We will provide more information as this process develops.\n\nIf you would like to determine whether you would be covered by a class action under the California Fair Pay Act (should it be filed), or have other questions about the potential lawsuit, reach out to [union officers]. ...\n\nPlease be aware that this is an intensive process and that we are juggling dozens of requests, so we will do our best to get back to you in a timely manner.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nQ: Should I retain my own attorney or file an individual lawsuit or wage claim?\n\nA: That is your right. However, we feel strongly the best way to address this issue is for the affected employees to stick together and pursue our plan as a unified group. The only way to ensure we fully correct the problem is to work as a group, not reach a series of individual agreements.\n\nQ: My manager has asked me to write a memo describing my accomplishments and asking for a raise. How should I proceed?\n\nA: We strongly advise you to avoid writing a memo or asking for a raise individually if you are a victim of pay discrimination. The best way to address this issue is as a group. But beyond that, we think it\u2019s highly problematic for managers to frame illegal pay discrimination \u2014 a systemic problem in our newsroom and in society \u2014 in terms of merit. You should never have to describe your achievements and qualifications in order to make the same as men or white people who do similar work as you. The exercise is offensive on its face and we should not participate.\n\nQ: What if I already submitted a memo?\n\nA: Here\u2019s some language we recommend sending to your manager: \u201cThe wage inequities identified by the Guild pay study show issues based on a systemic problem, not due to merit. Any merit increase would be on top of addressing such inequity. We ask that the Employer respond to the union\u2019s request to negotiate so these issues can be addressed for everyone.\u201d\n\nQ: Does the union think we should wipe out merit-based pay?\n\nA: Not at all. Pay equity and merit-based compensation are two separate issues. To be clear, the union is never opposed to management giving employees better compensation on the basis of merit.\n\nQ: Are there any records I should retain?\n\nA: Yes, if you have time you should download all of your information from Workday before the sale of the paper closes. Critical records include past performance reviews and salary history. You should also save copies of any communication with management or human resources about your salary or performance.\n\nQ: What if I am a victim of another form of pay discrimination, such as age?\n\nA: We\u2019re not leaving you behind, and we intend to investigate and address any claims of discrimination. Age discrimination is covered by a different law with a different standard of proof, so this will have to be considered separately. If you have concerns, please get in touch with us. ...\n\nThank you all for your strength and your resilience. Together, we will work to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.\n\n\u2014 The Los Angeles Times Guild Officers & Bargaining Committee"}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-school-shooting-injures-1-as-students-protest-gun-violence-nationwide_us_5ada1ceee4b029ebe023d9c6", "published": "2018-04-20T19:12:45", "title": "Gun Violence Prevents Florida School District From Staging Walkouts Against Gun Violence", "text": "Just as students around the country were preparing another walkout against gun violence on Friday morning, a 19-year-old man shot a 17-year-old student at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida.\n\nMarion County Sheriff Billy Woods identified the suspected shooter as Sky Bouche, a former student of the school.\n\nMarion County school officials canceled classes for the rest of the day. Students had planned protests there, a Marion school board member confirmed to CNN, but gun violence had stymied their efforts.\n\nCraig Ham, Marion County Public Schools\u2019 deputy superintendent of operations, told The Associated Press that Bouche was able to bring a shotgun onto campus by placing it in a guitar case and blending in with students. Once on campus, Bouche fired at the bottom of a locked classroom door, causing pellets to strike one student in the ankle.\n\nOutside the sheriff\u2019s office, Bouche told reporters that he \u201cshot through the door.\u201d Asked by a reporter whether he was sorry, Bouche said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it better anyway.\u201d\n\nWithin three minutes after hearing gunfire, Deputy James Long, the school\u2019s resource officer, located Bouche and detained him, Woods said at a news conference later Friday.\n\nBouche offered \u201cno resistance\u201d during his arrest, Woods said, adding that the motive for the shooting is unclear, though the suspect is cooperating with detectives. The FBI is looking into Bouche\u2019s history and is checking his computers.\n\nThe 17-year-old student, whom officials did not publicly identify, suffered injuries that are not considered life-threatening.\n\nWoods said the student told one of his deputies, \u201cI am so glad it was me and not one of my friends.\u201d\n\nThe attack occurred exactly 19 years to the day after two teens shot 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. It also comes at a moment when student activists, most of whom weren\u2019t yet born at the time of the Columbine tragedy, are stirring up momentum for gun policy reform.\n\nThe shooting has shaken the community.

It\u2019s the third major student-led protest since the tragedy at Stoneman Douglas.\n\nOcala is located around four hours north of Parkland by car in a state with some of the nation\u2019s most lax gun laws.\n\nAlthough organizers of Friday\u2019s walkout expect students at around 2,500 schools nationwide to participate, overall turnout is expected to be smaller than a similar event staged March 14, on the one-month anniversary of the Parkland shooting. At some schools, students are encouraged to take other action, too, by registering (or pre-registering) to vote and contacting their representatives.\n\nIn response to the Forest High School shooting, Woods said that every school campus in Marion County will have \u201cofficers and deputies present\u201d starting Monday morning \u201cto ensure that the parents know that law enforcement is there.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-signorile-pompeo-homophobia_us_5ad9ecdbe4b029ebe0237e87", "published": "2018-04-20T19:52:26", "title": "Mike Pompeo's Anti-Gay Views Should Disqualify Him", "text": "In 2011, the U.S. secretary of state made history when she declared at a United Nations assembly in Geneva that \u201cgay rights are human rights\u201d:\n\nLike being a woman, like being a racial, religious, tribal or ethnic minority, being LGBT does not make you less human. And that is why gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\n\nWith those words, Hillary Clinton announced that the U.S. would join nations around the world that not only condemn discrimination and brutality against LGBTQ people but also put actions behind those words. The Obama administration issued a presidential directive that day that would, among other things, leverage foreign assistance to nations to promote equal treatment of queer people, respond to human rights abuses against LGBTQ people internationally, and protect LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nFast-forward to 2018. The man under consideration to be President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state \u2015 the man on whose nomination the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to vote Monday \u2015 has suggested homosexuality is a \u201cperversion\u201d and quite proudly asserted that he doesn\u2019t believe same-sex couples should be treated the same as heterosexual couples.\n\nAny senator who votes to confirm Mike Pompeo is telling LGBTQ people, Muslims and others they are second-class citizens.\n\nPompeo, the current CIA director and a former Republican House member from Kansas who was a staunch tea party insurgent, put out a statement in 2015 calling the Supreme Court\u2019s marriage equality ruling a \u201cshocking abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThat same year, Pompeo spoke at a \u201cGod and Country Rally\u201d hosted by an evangelical church in Kansas and read a prayer that had been read on the floor of the Kansas legislature:\n\nAmerica had worshiped other Gods and called it multiculturalism. We\u2019d endorsed perversion and called it an alternative lifestyle.\n\nWhen Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) asked during Pompeo\u2019s confirmation hearing last week if he believes homosexuality is a perversion, Pompeo didn\u2019t skip a beat in responding:\n\nWhen I was a politician, I had a very clear view on whether it was appropriate for two same-sex persons to marry. I stand by that.\n\nWe can take that as a yes.\n\nI find it appalling that this man may become our next secretary of state. The duties of such a position include making sure America stands as a beacon of human rights and speaks out against discrimination and hatred around the world \u2015 a world where LGBTQ people are persecuted in many countries. (Trump\u2019s recently fired secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, recognized Pride Month \u2015 unlike Trump himself \u2015 and pushed for the inclusion of gay Scouts in the Boy Scouts of America, which he\u2019d headed in years past.)\n\nThis is no longer a debatable issue, and for Pompeo to frame it that way \u2015 as a matter of his opinion \u2015 is like saying that anti-discrimination protections for racial and ethnic minorities, religious groups or women are debatable. We should be well beyond allowing politicians to use religion as an excuse for discrimination against LGBTQ people. And with marriage equality as the law of the land in the United States, there is no place for the nation\u2019s chief diplomat to oppose that right.\n\nWe should be well beyond allowing politicians to use religion as an excuse for discrimination against LGBTQ people.\n\nThis is stupid politics, since few people elect a senator based on who the candidate did or didn\u2019t vote to confirm to the Cabinet or the federal judiciary.

Four weeks earlier, black teenagers at an IHOP in Maine were asked to pay before they received food. In both cases, and in many more that go unseen because there aren\u2019t enough moral whites uploading videos, black customers have to authenticate their existence.\n\nTo receive ordinary services and respect in white spaces, they need permission. They have to have perfect behavior and follow the \u201crules.\u201d And even then, they must convince the gatekeepers of white privilege they are special enough to share space.\n\nSocial theorist and academic W.E.B. DuBois conceived a century ago \u201cThe Talented Tenth.\u201d He was referring to exceptional black people as the solution to oppression; they would rescue the others who were struggling. However, whites have used the Talented Tenth model in various ways to restrict mostly everyone they didn\u2019t approve of. People of color were now faced with the steepest of all hurdles: equality, but as an option.\n\nNavigating and negotiating the white world comes with a litmus test. Outside of the exceptional brown-skinned person, everyone else will have to convince someone. In white spaces, people of color are visitors. At any moment, they can have their visitor card ripped out their hands. It is one more complication of equality. People of color have to prove they belong before they are accepted. Whites have to prove they don\u2019t belong before they are rejected.\n\nBut here is the problem with having to prove your humanity: It takes a fact and turns it into a question. \u201cYou are a decent human being\u201d suddenly becomes \u201cAre you a decent human being? Show me.\u201d It is performance art, a dance, with the person of color having to prove their worth.\n\nBlack people must convince the gatekeepers of white privilege they are special enough to share space.\n\nIn March, a group of teenagers in Maine went to an IHOP to grab a meal. They were seated and gave their order to the waitress, who politely asked them to pay before they were served. No one else in the restaurant had to pay first, only them. Before the teens could justify their existence, customers overheard the conversation and objected, and then posted the encounter on Facebook.\n\nThe IHOP manager, Melvin Escobar, apologized and said it was the first time an incident like that had ever happened. He rationalized the behavior of the waitress by saying teenagers had run out on their checks before.\n\nTherein is the solemn consequence of racism. We evaluate people of color by the worst of their group, not the best. The teens were guilty because they were teens. The teens were guilty because they were black.\n\nWhen Zora Neale Hurston wrote of herself \u201cI am not tragically colored,\u201d she could have been writing about the two men in Starbucks. They behaved proudly and were targeted and shamed. Their calm temperament wasn\u2019t enough to receive a benefit from white privilege.\n\nAfter being denied bathroom rights while waiting for a colleague, they refused to leave when they were told to, even when pressured by police authority. The paradox of their commitment is that they were behaving appropriately and yet they paid a price for it. It\u2019s the balancing act people of color have to face in white spaces. Be woke but receive your punishment.\n\nMark Makela / Reuters A Starbucks coffee cup with \"Stop calling cops!\" written on the side sits on a table as police monitor protesters inside a Starbucks in Philadelphia on Monday.\n\nDear white people: Equality is not optional. It is not a preference nor a benefit. It is also not a transaction you can use to absolve yourselves of racial bias by recording incidents and becoming white saviors. Fixing racism in America isn\u2019t about recording and then pressing send.\n\nFour friends were out for lunch in Southern California and were stunned when their server at Saint Marc in Huntington Beach asked for \u201cproof of residency.\u201d One of the friends, Diana Carrillo, a Latina business analyst, complained to the manager, then wrote about the encounter on Facebook. The waiter acted as if he had the authority to demand citizenship documentation in his zeal to protect his white space from women of color.\n\nIn 2017, the number of Americans who considered racism a major problem increased by 8 percentage points over the previous two years. Fifty-eight percent viewed racism as a big problem, according to the Pew Research Center study. Twenty-nine percent of the respondents said it was \u201csomewhat of a problem,\u201d and 12 percent thought racism was a small problem or not a problem at all. Two years earlier, only 50 percent of the population said it was a big problem, and in 2011 that number was as low as 28 percent.\n\nThat year, Barack Obama was still the president and bestowed upon the country a false sense of racial calm. The country had to be equal because the president was black. But because the president was black, he affirmed the DuBois \u201cTalented Tenth\u201d exception. Once Obama left office, heightened racial anxiety resurfaced, in a big way.\n\nAn eight-hour training session for Starbucks employees cannot reroute a 400-year system of preferences, advantages and racial biases\n\nSocial media has the tendency to take the worst of humanity and entertain us with the horror, like watching a car accident with mouths agape. Pretty quickly, everyone gets over it and it is business as usual. Starbucks continues to serve customers. IHOP continues to flip pancakes.\n\nThe CEO of Starbucks, Kevin Johnson, met with the two men the police handcuffed and said, \u201cI will fix this.\u201d Starbucks is closing thousands of stores to train employees on issues regarding racial discrimination. It is estimated to cost the company near $6 million.\n\nJohnson is serious and overconfident at the same time. Starbucks may be successful in advising employees that you don\u2019t call the police because a black person is waiting inside the store for a colleague. But an eight-hour training session cannot reroute a 400-year system of preferences, advantages and racial biases just because Johnson has good intentions.\n\nRacism begins in the heart and in the mind. Its antidote is believing all people are equal and that equality is not a benefit for the few."}, {"link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/play-doh-was-originally-meant-for-something-very-different_us_5ac51703e4b09ef3b24300db", "published": "2018-04-20T19:50:55", "title": "Play-Doh Was Originally Meant For Something Very Different", "text": "Play-Doh is undoubtedly an enduring classic in the children\u2019s toy world. So it may come as a surprise that it was not originally intended to be a toy.\n\nIn fact, it was a housekeeping product of sorts \u2015 a wallpaper cleaner.\n\nIn the late 1920s, a young man named Cleo McVicker was tasked with shutting down and selling off the remaining assets of a failing Cincinnati soap company called Kutol. In the process, however, he persuaded Kutol\u2019s parent company in Chicago to let him revive the brand and hired his brother Noah McVicker to help him turn things around.\n\nWhile heading the company in 1933, Cleo met with representatives from the Kroger grocery chain who were reportedly looking for a wallpaper cleaner to sell in their stores. At the time, burning coal was a common way to heat homes, but it left soot that was hard to clean off the wallpaper. (When vinyl wallpaper became more popular in the mid-20th century, you could simply clean it with soap and water, but this wasn\u2019t the case for earlier wallpapers.)\n\nCleo McVicker negotiated a contract between Kroger and Kutol, and his brother got to work inventing a version of the dough-like substance we\u2019ve come to know and love. All consumers had to do was roll it across their soiled walls to clean the soot and dirt.\n\nPlay-Doh\n\nPlay-Doh Play-Doh celebrated its cleaning product history in a video the brand released to celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2016.\n\nKutol\u2019s wallpaper cleaner was a fairly successful product, but the development of vinyl wallpaper and decline in the use of coal furnaces in favor of oil and gas meant there was less need for it after a while. In 1949, Cleo McVicker died in a plane crash, and his son, Joseph McVicker, and son-in-law, Bill Rhodenbaugh, came in to revive the company.\n\nThat\u2019s where the children\u2019s toy idea comes in.\n\nJoseph\u2019s sister-in-law Kay Zufall ran a nursery school and needed inexpensive materials to make Christmas decorations with her students around the holiday season in 1954. After reading an article about using wallpaper cleaner as modeling clay to make ornaments, she bought some of Kutol\u2019s product and brought it to school.\n\nIt was a big hit with the kids. They rolled it out and used cookie cutters to make shapes, which Zufall dried out in her oven to make ornaments. After telling Joseph about the success of the activity, he got to work re-inventing the product as a children\u2019s toy.\n\nHasbro A Play-Doh can from 1959, three years after the kid-friendly product went on the market.\n\nIn 1956, Joseph and Noah created Rainbow Crafts Company Inc. to manufacture and sell Play-Doh \u2015 a kid-friendly product name that Zufall and her husband Bob suggested. Originally an off-white color sold in one-gallon cans, the modeling compound was soon available in red, yellow and blue and in smaller packages.\n\nWoodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C., was the brand\u2019s first big account, and Play-Doh subsequently reached Macy\u2019s in New York and Marshall Field\u2019s in Chicago. A big break came in 1957 when Play-Doh was featured on popular children\u2019s TV shows. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nWhile Play-Doh\u2019s current parent company, Hasbro, declined to comment on the brand\u2019s back story, a representative shared a document about its journey.\n\n\u201cOriginally developed as a wallpaper cleaner, Play-Doh compound is now the #1 reusable modeling compound, with over 500 million cans produced each year,\u201d the document states.\n\nAnadolu Agency via Getty Images Jeff Koons' \"Play-Doh\" sculpture.\n\n\u201cTo date, more than 3 billion cans, of Play-Doh compound have been squished and squashed around the world. The Play-Doh brand remains just as beloved today, with compound and playsets sold in more than 80 countries,\u201d it notes.\n\nOver the years, kids and grown-ups alike have gotten creative with Play-Doh. There are competitions, tutorials for elaborate creations and even famous Play-Doh-inspired works of art.

States have a responsibility to protect inmates and prison staff\u2014and well-funded, properly staffed prisons can and do prevent widespread inmate violence or stop it swiftly when it occurs, prison experts say.\n\nLee Correctional Institution, the high-security prison where inmate fights broke out on April 15, houses violent offenders with longer sentences, as well as people with behavioral issues. The incidents started around 7:15 p.m., but a large emergency response team didn\u2019t enter the first dorm of three dorms until 11:30 p.m., officials said, and the last dorm hours later. CBS News obtained leaked video (not independently verified) that shows what McMaster apparently finds unsurprising: An eerie dystopia featuring an inmate smearing blood against a white wall and another roaming shirtless with a weapon that resembles a kitchen knife.\n\nThis is not a typical prison scene. As far as the death toll goes, the most recent comparable event was an 11-day riot\u2014in which inmates took multiple hostages\u2014that left nine inmates and one officer dead in an Ohio prison way back in 1993.\n\nPrison violence \u201cshouldn\u2019t be an expectation,\u201d said Robert Ayers, who worked at California\u2019s San Quentin State Prison from 1968 to 1987 and went on to serve as the warden at four California prisons. \u201cIt\u2019s almost, \u2019well, seven people died, but they were just inmates, and these are violent guys anyway ... so it\u2019s no big loss to society. That\u2019s extrapolating a lot, but I think there\u2019s an undercurrent out there that believes that.\u201d\n\nPeople need to be asking questions of the governor\u2019s office and the legislature, said Anthony Newland, a former warden of California State Prison Solano and former chief compliance officer for that state prison system. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that this kind of problem can happen \u2014 when there isn\u2019t enough money to run the system,\u201d Newland argued. \u201cThese things are preventable in prisons,\u201d he added.\n\nPrisons need to have enough staff to keep inmates and officers safe\n\nLee Correctional Institution has an understaffing problem. Security staff numbers continued to \u201clag behind the authorized strength [like officers],\u201d according to a FY2017 South Carolina Department of Corrections report. On April 1, 2017, there were 90 vacancies for frontline security positions at Lee \u2014 approximately half the facility\u2019s authorized positions, a state DOC spokesman told HuffPost. Those numbers have improved due to recruitment and retention efforts\u2014the number of vacancies was down to 52 as of April 1, 2018.\n\nBut a former Lee employee, who worked there from 2004 to 2012 and declined to be named due to pending litigation, said he still found those staffing numbers concerning. \u201cYou have to have a certain number of bodies in a certain number of places or you can\u2019t operate normally,\u201d the former employee said.\n\nCrises are the result of an inadequately funded prison system, one Democratic lawmaker argued. \u201cYes, stuff happens\u2014stuff happens because you neglect things, you underfund them, and you put people in danger,\u201d said state Rep. Todd Rutherford (D). He said that he doesn\u2019t blame the current DOC director, who\u2019s been \u201csounding the alarm bells about how understaffed and underfunded he is, how bad the prisons are, how hard his correctional officers are working.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina has had a large number of violent inmate deaths in recent years compared to other states. When there aren\u2019t enough officers\u2014or people like mental health professionals and maintenance staff\u2014staff may fear for their safety, and that in turn can allow violence to flourish. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the officers for what happened,\u201d the mother of a Lee inmate told the Anderson Independent Mail. \u201cMy son says the gang members do what they want to. That they will pull out shanks right in front of the guards.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk about understaffing without mentioning the nationwide push to reform mandatory minimum sentences and end mass incarceration in the U.S., issues that contribute to spiraling, problematic prison systems that disproportionately impact people of color.\n\nMcMaster\u2019s office did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment. But \u201cthe governor is committed to continuing to fund raises at the agency and will continue to do that as long as the agency is in need,\u201d a spokesman for the governor told NBC News. (South Carolina\u2019s average starting salary for officers this year was $33,289, according to NBC.)\n\nSmall indignities add up, yet some officials feign surprise when those treated inhumanely behave in inhumane ways. Issac Bailey for the Charlotte Observer\n\nCellphones: Potentially a symptom of a bigger problem\n\nOfficials have blamed the violence on gang conflicts over territory and contraband, particularly cellphones, which can be used to coordinate illegal activity. Officials are using the incident to push for signal-jamming at prisons.\n\nBut contraband is not a new issue, nor unique to South Carolina. And cellphones can be a symptom of wider security problems, prison experts say. (A prison can be fully staffed and still have security problems, though substantial understaffing makes things worse.) When staff can\u2019t adequately sweep for forbidden items, an economy can spring up that includes weapons. Some inmates may also feel like they need gang protection because they don\u2019t feel safe in the facility.\n\n\u201cCellphones did not stab people,\u201d said Justin Bamberg, a state representative and attorney who represents the family of an inmate killed in a different state prison on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cWhat did were some of those [multi]-inch blades.\u201d\n\nWhen there\u2019s severe understaffing, you\u2019re \u201cnot going to enforce simple rules and regulations, much less more serious stuff,\u201d the former Lee employee said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stay somewhere it\u2019s safe, which is like a staff area in the middle of the unit, where you don\u2019t see and you don\u2019t hear. And who can blame them?\u201d\n\nStaff \u201croutinely\u201d search correctional institutions for contraband, the South Carolina DOC spokesman told HuffPost, though he declined to provide more information about routines, citing security. The agency is installing netting at certain facilities to thwart people from throwing over contraband, he said.\n\nThis photo shows a man covered in blood sitting against a wall as another man approaches him during the prison riot.\n\nCBS News\n\nWhy did it take hours to get control of the dorms?\n\nLee conducts monthly emergency training, the DOC spokesman said, and there are three teams with specialized training that assisted in responding to the violence. Lee is located in a rural area, about an hour from Columbia, which may have increased the time it took to gather sufficient numbers of staff to respond to the crisis.\n\nBut experts have wondered how the violence was able to spread unchecked to multiple dorms, rather than the facility being swiftly secured. It\u2019s also concerning how long it reportedly took an emergency team to re-enter and take control of the areas under siege, Jeffrey Schwartz, a consultant who has worked with correctional agencies and law enforcement for more than 30 years, told HuffPost. \u201cWhether it\u2019s staff or inmates,\u201d he said, \u201cyour commitment to saving life has to be the same.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s why prison reform advocates find the governor\u2019s statement so troubling\u2014 it suggests prison is supposed to be a violent place.\n\nThe incident is \u201cmore than just a tragedy,\u201d a group of state Democratic lawmakers wrote to McMaster on Thursday. \u201cWe are concerned it is indicative of much bigger problems within correctional facilities in South Carolina.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hurt. I wept.

But there\u2019s one specific type of salad that can do even more for your brain than it can for your belly.\n\nMax Lugavere, author of the new book Genius Foods: Become Smarter, Happier, and More Productive While Protecting Your Brain for Life, is on a mission to help us boost our health with the foods we eat every day, which have a surprisingly powerful effect on our brain function. One of the many healthy habits he promotes is eating what he calls a \u201chuge fatty salad\u201d once every day.\n\nThe concept suggests that eating one huge daily salad \u2015 specifically, one that\u2019s packed with a combination of nutrient-dense vegetables, protein and extra-virgin olive oil \u2015 can work wonders for your brain. You know, the organ that controls EVERY OTHER ORGAN IN YOUR BODY.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple concept that could reap huge health benefits. Here\u2019s how to master the huge fatty salad.\n\nSize matters.\n\nIf you\u2019re not the world\u2019s most enthusiastic fan of lettuce-based foodstuffs, you might see the words \u201chuge\u201d and \u201csalad\u201d together and bail out on this concept entirely. But don\u2019t freak out. Lugavere says the definition of huge will differ for everyone. It\u2019s more about giving salad a more prominent role in your diet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to think about the salad not as a side dish, but as the dish. Really make that your entr\u00e9e,\u201d Lugavere told HuffPost.\n\nBut for everyone who does like to eat their salads out of a ridiculously large mixing bowl, the huge fatty salad is perfect validation for eating a giant salad on the couch with a towel-turned-bib on your chest.\n\nWhat\u2019s inside counts, too.\n\nStep away from the iceberg lettuce. Don\u2019t you even dare.\n\nLugavere\u2019s ideal foundation for the huge fatty salad is a trio of dark, leafy greens: kale, spinach and arugula.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a trio that\u2019s really powerful,\u201d Lugavere said. \u201cKale is incredibly nutrient dense, and a top source of magnesium and lutein. Spinach is a top source of folate and magnesium. And arugula is unique because it\u2019s a top source of nitrate, which is uniquely important in terms of its ability to promote healthy blood vessel function, which is profoundly important for the brain. Research has found that one single high-nitrate meal could improve cognitive function.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Max Lugavere (@maxlugavere) on Mar 6, 2018 at 9:35am PST\n\nOn top of that foundation, Lugavere says in his book that \u201cthe beauty of crafting salads is that there are no rules.\u201d He\u2019s a fan of tossing in healthy proteins like wild salmon or grass-fed beef, and another key is ensuring you incorporate as many vegetables as possible.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out what to put in the bowl, perhaps the most essential element of the fatty salad is topping it with the perfect dressing.\n\nHuge fatty salad, you are nothing without extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nIt\u2019s true what they say: You really do need fats on your salad to best absorb the nutrients from all the vegetables in a salad.\n\n\u201cThere are a myriad of vitamins that are fat-soluble, as well as non-vitamin nutrients like carotenoids, which are positively associated with better brain function. Their absorption is negligible unless consumed with fat,\u201d Lugavere said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re consuming a fat-free salad, it\u2019s a massively missed opportunity to absorb these carotenoids, which research shows can actually boost visual processing speed\u201d \u2015 the pace at which you perceive and respond to things \u2015 \u201cby 20 percent, even if you\u2019re young and healthy.\u201d\n\nBut you need the right kind of fat. You\u2019re not giving your brain its best shot if you\u2019re using anything but extra-virgin olive oil, which contains intense anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil contains a compound called oleocanthal, which is what gives olive oil the peppery flavor that makes you choke when you inhale too quickly. As Genius Foods explains, \u201coleocanthal possesses anti-inflammatory effects so powerful that it is comparable to taking a small dose of ibuprofen, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, but without any of the potential side effects.\u201d\n\nAnti-inflammatories are essential to strong brain function, because inflammation can strongly negate neuroplasticity, which Luvagere describes as \u201cthe ability of the brain to change throughout life.\u201d And we need that.\n\nRegular olive oil won\u2019t cut it. Here\u2019s why.\n\nDon\u2019t assume regular olive oil is just as good for your brain as extra-virgin. Regular olive oil is processed, and extra-virgin is unprocessed. As is the case with most foods, processing creates some undesirable qualities in olive oil.\n\n\u201cThe production process can actually create trans-fats, which you don\u2019t want lingering in your olive oil,\u201d Lugavere explained. Not only does that make regular olive oil a less healthy option that extra-virgin, but it also puts it on par with a slew of other oils that Lugavere says we should avoid.\n\nAvoid \u201cominous oils.\u201d They\u2019re lurking where you\u2019d least suspect them.\n\nLugavere points out there are several \u201cominous oils\u201d to watch out for: Canola oil, corn oil, soybean oil, vegetable oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, grapeseed oil, rice bran oil.\n\nWait, what?\n\nThese oils contain polyunsaturated fats, which when intact in whole foods are protected from oxidation, which leads to inflammation. But once these oils are exposed to heat and chemical processing, \u201cthey represent one of the major toxins in our food supply,\u201d according to Genius Foods.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important to make your own dressing with extra-virgin olive oil. And beware of \u201chealthy\u201d products and restaurants without fully inspecting their ingredients.\n\nMany bottled dressings that tout olive oil on their labels are often filled with other \u201cominous oils.\u201d For example, Newman\u2019s Own Olive Oil & Vinegar Dressing contains a blend of extra-virgin and regular olive oil, but it\u2019s also made with \u201cvegetable oil (soybean oil and/or canola oil.\u201d Similarly, Kraft\u2019s Italian Olive Oil Vinaigrette contains canola oil and soybean oil in addition to extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nNot even healthy salad restaurant chains are immune from serving dressings with the \u201cominous oils.\u201d Lugavere points out that Sweetgreen, in particular, uses grapeseed oil in their salad dressings. Always be sure to ask restaurants which oils they use.\n\nIf you love rules and hate creativity, here are two specific recipes to follow.\n\nHere are two ideas from Genius Foods. As Lugavere says, feel free to improve on them:\n\nKale, cucumber, thinly sliced jalape\u00f1o chiles, raw broccoli, sunflower seeds, avocado, grilled chicken, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, lemon\n\nSpinach, arugula, tomatoes, bell peppers, chia seeds, avocado, grilled shrimp, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, minced raw garlic, lemon\n\nNow that you\u2019ve read this far, you should realize that a \u201cfatty salad\u201d isn\u2019t a \u201csalad for fatties,\u201d but rather a big old salad loaded with healthy fats that\u2019ll boost your brain function. It\u2019s really the least you can do for your noggin\u2019.

Following a federal judicial clerkship for future Third Circuit Chief Judge D. Brooks Smith, he practiced for over 23 years at the prestigious firm Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney, where he has handled hundreds of litigation matters and acquired expertise on an extensive span of issues: constitutional law, election law, labor law, media law, intellectual-property law, banking law, corporate law, and civil rights.\n\nFor several years, he has been named to the Pennsylvania Super Lawyers list and included in The Best Lawyers in America list. Widely respected among his colleagues, he is an elected member of the American Law Institute, has served on the Pennsylvania State Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and was elected chair of the Federal Court and Civil Litigation sections of the Allegheny County Bar Association. Of the latter, prominent Pittsburgh criminal-defense lawyer Tina O. Miller wrote as she endorsed Porter\u2019s nomination that \u201cone does not become elected to the governing Council of the Federal Court Section, or become chair of the section, unless one has earned the respect of the lawyers, judges, and bar association leaders who represent the various interests of the entire federal bar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, Porter is being attacked by the left-wing Pennsylvania groups Keystone Progress and Why Courts Matter-Pennsylvania (WCM-PA). To be more precise, those groups are dusting off their attacks from 2014, when they helped scuttle a potential bipartisan recommendation to President Obama from Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican and Democratic senators to nominate Porter to a district-court judgeship.\n\nThe basis for their opposition: Porter is a conservative whose views are supposedly \u201cextreme.\u201d Why? The specifics do not venture beyond the range of views and associations one would expect of any accomplished conservative attorney who is a leader in the profession:\n\nPorter was an outspoken opponent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He wrote an op-ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette while the law was being challenged in the Supreme Court arguing that it was unconstitutional. His views happened to be the same as those of the four Supreme Court justices who ultimately dissented from the Court\u2019s judgment in that case, not to mention his home state of Pennsylvania, which had challenged the ACA.\n\nHe is a member of the Board of Trustees of Grove City College, an Evangelical school and his alma mater, and a contributor to the college\u2019s Center for Vision and Values (CVV). In an odd attempt at guilt by association, WCM-PA links to a CVV-published essay and a CVV presentation announcement, neither of which involved Porter.\n\nHe is president of the Pittsburgh Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society. The Society has for years established itself as one of the nation\u2019s premier professional organizations. Its members have included several Supreme Court justices and numerous federal circuit judges, and speakers participating in Federalist Society programs have included some of the nation\u2019s leading liberal constitutional scholars. The Society does not take positions, but does regularly host experts on both right and left. Among them, the Pittsburgh Chapter hosted Roger Clegg, whose Center for Equal Opportunity has taken positions in favor of color-blind government policies and challenged the constitutionality of diversity-based racial quotas.\n\nHe has donated to Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers, a list that WCM-PA headlines as including former Senator Rick Santorum and current Senator Pat Toomey. The headline would have packed less ideological punch had it mentioned that Porter had also donated to former Senator Arlen Specter \u2014 a higher total, in fact, than he has given to Toomey. Such donations are not particularly noteworthy. What Porter donated to Pennsylvania\u2019s incumbent Republican senator is less than 1 percent of what Judge William Orrick III bundled or donated to President Obama before he was appointed to the Northern District of California in 2013.\n\nDating back to John Adams\u2019s representation of the British soldiers charged with murder after the Boston Massacre, there is a venerable American tradition of not disqualifying an attorney from public office based upon the identity of his or her clients, no matter how detestable they might be. The activists aligned against Porter have disregarded this tradition, attacking him based on the fact that his past clients include former Senator Santorum and Republican members of Pennsylvania\u2019s state legislature, the latter in a case involving a challenge to a law that permitted natural gas drilling. These clients are not exactly enemies of America or serial killers, but perhaps they are just as alarming to ultra-left activists.\n\nPorter was part of a network of conservatives (including WCM-PA\u2019s bogeyman Rick Santorum) that organized in opposition to the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. Thirty-one senators agreed and voted against her confirmation. Justice Sotomayor has since become arguably the most strident liberal on the Court.\n\nThe positions Porter\u2019s critics identify with him outside the courtroom \u2014 even throwing in the ones that do not involve statements he himself made \u2014 align with the views of at least four recent or current Supreme Court justices: Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and very likely the recently appointed Gorsuch. If we exclude the issue of the ACA, add Chief Justice Roberts to make that five. If Porter were nominated to the Supreme Court, he would be in good company.\n\nOf course, Porter has been nominated to a lower court, where he is bound to follow Supreme Court precedent. In addition to a number of diverse organizations supporting his nomination, two attorneys who are self-described staunch Democrats and who have known Porter for over 20 years have expressed unreserved confidence in his ability to serve on the Third Circuit. \u201cI am absolutely confident that, if confirmed, he will decide every case based upon the applicable law and not upon politics or personal ideology,\u201d asserted health-care attorney Thomas L. Vankirk. Corporate attorney Thomas M. Thompson attested that Porter \u201chas the type of legal judgment, respect for precedent, temperament and calming influence that is much needed on the bench no matter which political leaning.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why listen to them when there is Michael Morrill, the founder of Keystone Progress, who never met Porter but nonetheless claimed \u201cit\u2019s hard to believe he would be a fair and even-handed judge\u201d? Guess whose opinion will receive the most credence from Senate Democrats.\n\nIt is unremarkable, if regrettable, that these petty attacks blocked a conservative from being nominated by Obama back in 2014, but it would be a shame if anyone outside the echo chamber of liberal interest groups seriously bought the argument that Porter lacks the experience, character, or temperament to serve on the Third Circuit."}, {"link": "https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/scott-gottlieb-food-and-drug-administration-record/", "published": "2018-04-21T00:45:00", "title": "Scott Gottlieb -- FDA Record", "text": "Here, grab my hand and I\u2019ll yank you up atop the ramparts with us so you can join the fight against the enemies of all we hold dear.

The first is that the fact that states that wish to tax outside their jurisdictions have banded together to create taxing arrangements by itself demonstrates that what they are trying to do impinges on commerce among the states. The second is that whether letting states have the taxing power many of them seek would be efficient ought to be beside the point for the justices. Arguments about efficiency \u201care little more than efforts to drag this Court into an inappropriate policy-making role and have no constitutional warrant. Just as efficiency is manifestly not the point of the separation of powers, technical efficiency likewise is not the point of federalism.\u201d\n\nI hope the justices listen."}, {"link": "https://www.nationalreview.com/g-file/rebels-corporate-conformity-culture-being-different/", "published": "2018-04-20T22:58:20", "title": "Rebels, Corporate Conformity & Culture", "text": "Britney Spears at the GLAAD Media Awards in Beverly Hills, Calif., April 12, 2018.

Oh, right. When I lived in Prague, I took a lovely young Czech lady on a date to see The Silence of the Lambs (not a Warren Zevon or Dr. Demento lyric). She was considerably horrified \u2014 and even more confused \u2014 by this \u201cAmerican movie.\u201d At one point, she peeked out from behind the hands covering her eyes (her hands, not mine), and asked in her stilted English syntax, \u201cHe thinks it is good to eat people, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cHe thinks it is good to eat people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she replied and put her hands back over her eyes.\n\nI bring this up because people believe all sorts of weird things, and not all of them involve pairing Chianti with a human liver.\n\nFor some reason, I\u2019ve been thinking about this ever since I had a conversation with Charlie Cooke \u2014 always a pleasant experience because he sounds so charming, like a nature-documentary narrator or a Nazi general in World War II movie. We were talking about Kevin Williamson, and Charlie made a point about what happens when you engage out-of-the-box writers \u2014 and by \u201cout-of-the-box,\u201d I mean the terrible clich\u00e9 about unconventional thinking, not a creepy reference to exhuming, say, Gore Vidal, and removing him from his coffin (\u201cJust don\u2019t pull out the stake!\u201d).\n\nCharlie observed that the same thing that gives a great writer \u2014 or, really, anybody \u2014 the ability to see things from a different perspective also probably implies that they have some unconventional views on all sorts of things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy dad certainly had that, which explains so many strange things that came out of his mouth. When I was a kid, he used to tell me that, given my lack of marketable skills or material contributions to the family unit, I could be \u201creplaced by a well-trained monkey.\u201d Every Thanksgiving, he\u2019d begin the meal by pointing out that on a planet of super-intelligent and technologically advanced turkeys, the gruesome scene before us would be a soul-shaking horror, and probably a cause for war. At the end of the meal, he\u2019d always turn to me, gesture to the picked-over carcass of the turkey sitting between us, and ask, \u201cJonah, if we gathered the world\u2019s great scientists and doctors, do you think there\u2019s any chance we could save this bird\u2019s life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, of course, there was my dad\u2019s logically sound belief that if we could just shrink all humans to, say, the size of a G.I.

Indeed, most of this stuff was just his way of having fun with me. But, as I get older, I treasure those memories because they make me laugh and because they shaped how I see the world. Another point of all this, I guess, is that our minds can take us to stranger places than conventional society is willing to consider. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone who has read this \u201cnews\u201dletter over the years could disagree with that.\n\nThe Division of Meaning\n\nThe point I thought this \u201cnews\u201dletter was getting at, however, is that we have really strange views on conformity. In my Friday column, which I will confess to writing hastily as this is a bananas time for me (\u201cDid someone say \u2018banana time\u2019?\u201d \u2014 Koko), I borrowed a page from G. K. Chesterton and quoted Britney Spears talking this week about how America demands conformity from people. \u201cI feel like our society has always put such an emphasis on what\u2019s normal,\u201d Britney said, \u201cand to be different is unusual or seen as strange.\u201d\n\nBritney\u2019s whole \u201cspeech\u201d seemed like the kind of thing Spock and Kirk might say to Harcourt Fenton Mudd\u2019s android to make its head explode.

Second, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s another country in the world that celebrates being different as much as we do. Okay, maybe Holland or Canada, but not many places.

Matthew McConaughey\u2019s ads for Lincoln make him seem like a scary drifter on a quest to make a suit out of waitresses who work at out-of-the-way diners. BMW just launched an ad appealing to \u201cunfollowers\u201d to follow their lead straight to the dealership. Audi has a dude forgoing the witness-protection program because he can\u2019t contemplate being the kind of sell-out who drives a normal car. Better to take your chances with the mob than not sit behind the wheel of an Audi.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m kind of proving Britney\u2019s point, though not in the way she thinks \u2014 because non-conformity is one of the most conformist values we have today. Everyone is special, which as Dash famously pointed out, means no one is. In Bobos in Paradise, David Brooks observes that everything \u201ctransgressive\u201d gets \u201cdigested by the mainstream bourgeois order, and all the cultural weapons that once were used to undermine middle-class morality . . . are drained of their subversive content.\u201d\n\nWe still have a middle-class ideology, but the virtues, habits, and pieties have changed.\n\nAs I wrote a while ago, the idea of gay marriage went from being subversive and radical to conventional and boring in a remarkably short period of time. Will & Grace was edgy because it both depicted a relatively uptight and restrained gay dude \u2014 which ran against the stereotype \u2014 and because it depicted another gay dude who leaned all the way into the stereotype. A short time later, Modern Family depicted gay marriage as being basically indistinguishable from traditional marriage (\u201cI can\u2019t get the baby-seat in the car!\u201d).\n\nI used to think Brooks was largely correct. Now, not so much. It is certainly true that everything transgressive gets digested by the mainstream order; I\u2019m just not sure the mainstream order is bourgeois. \u201cBourgeois\u201d used to mean something different than it does today. It was a middle-class ideology rooted in certain virtues, habits, and pieties. We still have a middle-class ideology, but the virtues, habits, and pieties have changed \u2014 a few for the better, and a few for the worse.\n\n(As I discuss in my new book), last summer, Amy Wax and Larry Alexander penned an op-ed praising the old bourgeois values \u2014 and by \u201cold\u201d I don\u2019t mean the 18th century. The bourgeois culture of the 1940s to 1960s, Wax and Alexander wrote, laid out \u201cthe script we all were supposed to follow\u201d:\n\nGet married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime.\n\nA coalition of students and alumni responded to the essay in predictable fashion. Wax and Alexander were peddling the \u201cmalignant logic of hetero-patriarchal, class-based, white supremacy that plagues our country today. These cultural values and logics are steeped in anti-blackness and white hetero-patriarchal respectability . . .\u201d\n\nNow, I know, when most normal people read this they find an uncontrollable urge to pantomime an onanistic gesture:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, if bourgeois culture means something other than \u201cwhatever everyone considers normal,\u201d you can\u2019t keep redefining what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d and still glibly call it \u201cbourgeois\u201d without some follow-up explanation.\n\nAs Charles Murray has pointed out repeatedly, our elites still practice something very close to bourgeois lifestyles (though formal religion plays less of a role today). Members of our new upper-middle class tend to wait until they\u2019re finished with their education before they get married, and they wait until they\u2019re married before they have kids. They save money and work hard, and they teach their children to do the same. What they don\u2019t do is teach other people to do likewise \u2014 because that would be judgmental. As Charles puts it, they don\u2019t preach what they practice, which is a worse form of hypocrisy than the reverse, because the education-marriage-kids \u201csuccess sequence\u201d is literally one of the only, and certainly one of the best, ways for poor people to get out of poverty.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize until writing this sentence that Kevin Williamson actually makes a similar point in the Wall Street Journal today. Feminists and various other identity-politics activists claim to be fighting an entrenched power structure. But, in reality, they\u2019re closer to the rebels who have to drive an Audi. Kevin writes:\n\nWhich brings us back to that event at South by Southwest, where the Atlantic was sponsoring a panel about marginalized points of view and diversity in journalism. The panelists, all Atlantic writers and editors, argued that the cultural and economic decks are stacked against feminists and advocates of minority interests. They made this argument under the prestigious, high-profile auspices of South by Southwest and their own magazine, hosted by a feminist group called the Female Quotient, which enjoys the patronage of Google, PepsiCo, AT&T, NBCUniversal, Facebook, UBS, JPMorgan Chase and Deloitte. We should all be so marginalized. If you want to know who actually has the power in our society and who is actually marginalized, ask which ideas get you sponsorships from Google and Pepsi and which get you fired.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go all Gabriel Kolko on people (in part because no one remembers him anymore), but when Starbucks closes 8,000 stores for diversity-sensitivity training \u2014 virtue-signaling on a continental scale \u2014 perhaps the ideology of the corporate power structure isn\u2019t what you think it is.\n\nMy objection isn\u2019t to Starbucks\u2019s decision per se. Nor is it with the arguments made by various progressive warriors sponsored by the RAMJAC corporation \u2014 it\u2019s with the claim that they\u2019re rebels rather than props. Our colleges teach kids that being liberal or left-wing is rebellious, but there\u2019s nothing rebellious about it. Rather, the claims of rebelliousness are the coating that makes the pill of conformity easier to swallow. The examples that demonstrate this are all too familiar \u2014 from the Google memo to, well, Kevin Williamson.\n\nRebellion is the fashion, and claims of oppression and persecution are the cultural currency.\n\nThere\u2019s still room in our culture to be different, though the irony is that wearing a gray flannel suit today is more rebellious than wearing, well, almost anything. Being an atheist on a college campus isn\u2019t rebellious; it\u2019s one of the most tedious forms of conformity. A real rebel talks out loud in an Ivy League classroom about how Jesus Christ is his or her personal savior. For today\u2019s kids, it\u2019s okay to have weird, eccentric, or oddball ideas, so long as they don\u2019t rub against the grain of what Everyone Is Supposed to Believe. I mean, we live in an age where Satanists don the mantle of rebellion but are quick to clarify they\u2019re not crazy like \u2014 you know \u2014 those whacky Christians.\n\nI\u2019d have so much more respect for the progressives who control the commanding heights of our culture if they had the courage to admit that they control the commanding heights of the culture and that they\u2019re in the business of imposing orthodoxy. But they can\u2019t do that because, in America, rebellion is the fashion, and claims of oppression and persecution are the cultural currency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and by the way, many conservatives today have much the same problem. Right-wingers want to get people who say mean things fired, too. Republicans control the government in Washington (and most of the state governments, as well), but all the usual suspects make it sound like they\u2019re a persecuted political sect.\n\nThere are differences between the two groups of course. But the pose is the same: Everyone\u2019s gotta be a victim and a rebel \u2014 because everyone\u2019s doing it.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nI am severely pressed for time today, so I have to keep this short.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe book goes on sale April 24, but of course you can preorder it and keep me from cutting myself any further.\n\nI\u2019m doing an enormous amount of media starting next week.

There is no doubt about that. He is competent \u2014 as director of the CIA, he has managed a complex organization deftly, winning the respect of intelligence professionals otherwise not favorably inclined to President Trump. He is experienced \u2014 in an administration with more than its share of neophytes, he has served in Washington, initially as a congressman, since 2011. He is highly credentialed \u2014 he graduated top of his class at West Point and went to Harvard Law School, where he edited the Harvard Law Review.\n\nSo the fight over his confirmation isn\u2019t about his abilities, but instead is a raw power play to deny President Trump a top cabinet official. The reasons that Democrats are coming up with to oppose him are transparently weak. New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen, who supported his nomination as CIA director, says she can\u2019t support him for secretary of state because he opposes gay marriage and is pro-life. By this standard, we\u2019ll never have a secretary of state again who doesn\u2019t have the endorsement of NARAL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShaheen is on the foreign-relations committee, which for the first time ever won\u2019t give a secretary of state nominee its blessing.\n\nPompeo will probably get confirmed anyway, but he needs Democratic votes because Steve Bannon and Rand Paul have, in effect, conspired to make the Republican-controlled Senate incapable of governing. Bannon, of course, backed to the hilt Roy Moore, who lost a Senate seat in ruby-red Alabama, reducing the Republican majority to 51\u201349. John McCain\u2019s absence reduces the GOP margin further. And Rand Paul continues to be the single most destructive Republican senator, embracing a suicidal purity on budgetary matters and insisting that national-security nominees meet his wholly unrealistic standard of U.S. appeasement and withdrawal in foreign affairs. Paul is, naturally, opposed to Pompeo. That the Kentucky senator routinely undermines his own party and Trump\u2019s agenda yet still remains in the good graces of the president is one of the great mysteries of Washington.\n\nAnother Republican, Jeff Flake of Arizona, has also hinted at opposing Pompeo based on travel restrictions to Cuba. We don\u2019t share Flake\u2019s enthusiasm for dealing with the island dictatorship, but, regardless, this is not an issue to block a secretary of state over, especially given the ongoing mystery over damaging sound attacks suffered by our embassy employees in Havana.\n\nThe good news is that Heidi Heitkamp, the Democrat from North Dakota, came out in favor of Pompeo\u2019s nomination yesterday. A few more red-state Democrats will probably follow suit. Even if Pompeo gets confirmed, the vote will be historically narrow. This isn\u2019t a commentary on his merits, but on the intensity of the Democratic opposition to Trump \u2014 and an unwelcome sign of things to come if Democrats take back the Senate next year."}, {"link": "https://www.nationalreview.com/podcasts/the-remnant-with-jonah-goldberg/episode-34-the-cleanest-dirty-shirt/", "published": "2018-04-20T21:57:08", "title": "The Remnant Podcast with Jonah Goldberg: Ian Bremmer", "text": "Ezra Klein wants you to know that he doesn\u2019t think Sam Harris is a racist. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say you\u2019re racist, I don\u2019t think you are,\u201d Klein explains in a two-hour debate with Harris on the latter\u2019s podcast, Waking Up. \u201cWe have not called you one.\u201d No, not at all.

Klein is telling the truth here. Why so touchy, Sam?\n\nKlein\u2019s site Vox, in a piece by scientists Eric Turkheimer, Kathryn Paige Harden, and Richard E. Nisbett, merely tagged Harris as participating in \u201cpseudoscientific racialist speculation\u201d and peddling \u201cjunk science\u201d while being \u201cegregiously wrong morally\u201d and implied he\u2019s on the same side as eugenicists, claiming that the burden of proof is on Harris to demonstrate that he isn\u2019t. The piece was listed as one of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201chatewatch headlines\u201d of the day, right alongside news about neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Klein himself then chimed in with an attack piece saying Harris was carrying on with \u201cAmerica\u2019s most ancient justification for bigotry and racial inequality.\u201d All of this because Harris had a podcast conversation with Charles Murray, the co-author of The Bell Curve, which contains a chapter about race and IQ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Klein to maintain that he and his site didn\u2019t call Harris a racist is dishonest. In so many words, they did. His dissimulation reveals something important about him: He\u2019s in the business of intellectual demagoguery. He debases the tone of good-faith debate. He whips up crowds using smears. Then he denies he did any such thing.\n\nAssociating hate with Harris is bizarre. I\u2019ve grown fond of his preternaturally composed, hyper-rational style on the Waking Up podcast. But when he talks about Klein, he is not quite himself. He can\u2019t disguise his bewilderment. He sounds like Spock discovering his shorts are on fire. \u201cCaptain, I have detected . . . flames and singed flesh . . . in the vicinity of . . . my perineum.\u201d His tone remains steady, but the words are uncharacteristically pointed. During the debate, as Klein keeps delivering lectures to Harris on the history of racist injustice and repeatedly accuses him of having a \u201cblind spot,\u201d you can hear Harris sighing. Does Harris \u2014 does any intelligent person \u2014 really need to be told that blacks have been victimized by racism? Of course they have been. It\u2019s a different conversation from the one about what we do and don\u2019t know about IQ scores.\n\nHarris, who has to his credit a philosophy degree from Stanford, a Ph.D. from UCLA in cognitive neuroscience, and several well-reviewed books, has described himself as on the left on virtually every issue. How disorienting it must have been to find himself reclassified as a neo-Mengele and besieged by the social-media mob because he spoke with Murray. His reputation, he says on another episode, was severely damaged. He believes the bloodlust Klein successfully instigated on social media would have gotten him fired if had been on staff at a mainstream media outlet or university. People go bananas if someone cries racism, regardless of whether the charge is founded.\n\nBecause of The Bell Curve, Murray has long been demonized on the left as a racist and a white supremacist. Harris hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the book in the quarter-century since it was published but said in the debate with Klein (this is the transcript) that he had been under the impression that \u201cit must be just racist trash, because I assumed that where there was all that smoke, there must be fire.\u201d After reading The Bell Curve, though, he came to think that Murray \u201cwas probably the most unfairly maligned person in my lifetime\u201d because \u201cthe most controversial passages in the book struck me as utterly mainstream with respect to the science.\u201d Harris doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with Murray\u2019s policy ideas, but wouldn\u2019t rule them outside the boundaries of discussion.\n\nIf you have the law on your side, argue the law. If you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. If you have neither on your side, call your opponent a racist.\n\nThe core of the disagreement between Klein and Harris is that Klein thinks Murray should be treated as radioactive, and name-calling is his method for making that happen. Harris thinks Murray\u2019s science is sound and that the attacks on the two of them in Vox were misleading, vicious, and ad hominem. Harris cites, for instance, a recent New York Times op-ed by Harvard professor David Reich that says \u201cas a geneticist I also know that it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among \u2018races,\u2019\u201d as well as an essay by Richard Haier, a psychologist and editor in chief of the journal Intelligence, which directly charges Turkheimer et al. with misrepresenting what The Bell Curve says, adds that some of their assertions about race and IQ run contrary to the weight of evidence, and note that its core arguments have been challenged many times by experts. Haier offered the piece to Vox, which rejected it. New York magazine\u2019s Andrew Sullivan, a friend to both Klein and Harris, took Harris\u2019s side in a column, saying Klein didn\u2019t have a satisfying response to the scientific argument and \u201cseems to back a truly extreme position: that only the environment affects IQ scores.\u201d What\u2019s even more troubling, Sullivan writes, is Klein\u2019s \u201cattempt to smear legitimate conservative ideas and serious scientific arguments as the equivalent of peddling white supremacy and bigotry\u201d via \u201cstigmatization and demonization.\u201d\n\nIn short, it appears that it\u2019s Klein\u2019s Vox, not Murray, and certainly not Harris, that is pushing views outside the mainstream of scientific research about intelligence. Klein\u2019s central role in this is repugnant. To adapt the legal adage: If you have the law on your side, argue the law. If you have the facts on your side, argue the facts. If you have neither on your side, call your opponent a racist. This was also O. J. Simpson\u2019s strategy.\n\nIt worked for Simpson, and to an extent, it worked for Klein. At least Simpson did it to save himself, though. Klein does it because he\u2019d rather destroy the reputation of a fellow liberal than acknowledge being on the losing side of an argument."}, {"link": "https://www.nationalreview.com/news/broward-county-sheriff-faces-vote-of-no-confidence-from-deputies/", "published": "2018-04-20T21:21:30", "title": "Broward County Sheriff Faces \u2018Vote of No Confidence\u2019 from Deputies", "text": "Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel speaks at CNN\u2019s town hall meeting, February 21, 2018.
