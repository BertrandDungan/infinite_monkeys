Show Hide Who are the Windrush generation? They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948. What is happening to them? An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it. Why is this happening now? It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary, to make the UK 'a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants'. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people\u2019s citizenship or immigration status. Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status? Some children, often travelling on their parents\u2019 passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973. What is the government doing to resolve the problem? On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd announced the creation of a new Home Office team dedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally. Photograph: Douglas Miller/Hulton Archive\n\nThe Labour MP David Lammy and the Jamaican prime minister, Andrew Holness, are among those to have called for compensation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the press conference, the prime minister of Grenada, Keith Mitchell, said he believed May and the UK government should be doing more to address the situation.\n\nAmber Rudd boasted of harsher immigration strategy, leak reveals Read more\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no question,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly it\u2019s something which is vibrating strongly in the Caribbean region as a whole. Many of our people came here and helped to build Britain, under conditions that were set for them. For me, it\u2019s very unfair for them to be treated in the way they have been treated.\n\n\u201cThe word compensation came out today - that was highly significant, extremely important. It\u2019s not just, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 People lost a lot, people suffered a lot of pain, and they must be given an opportunity to correct this \u2013 some serious compensation. If not the person, if they\u2019ve gone, then the families who have suffered, too.\u201d\n\nAsked if May should accept her \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy was a mistake, Mitchell praised the prime minister for pledging to address the crisis.\n\n'I thought I would die': Windrush man left homeless after brain surgery Read more\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the fact she has addressed it is indicating that Britain and the policy they enunciated initially was not the right one.

And I\u2019ll give her credit for making the right turn.\u201d\n\nReacting to May\u2019s announcement, Sarah O\u2019Connor, 57, who moved to Britain from Jamaica 51 years ago when she was six, and faced bankruptcy after she was unable to take up a new job last year because she had no papers, said she was interested to hear about compensation but mainly felt rage with the government at the emerging scandal.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so angry that you have to go through all the anxiety, depression and feeling scared for it all to come to the surface,\u201d she said. |People must have known in the Home Office that Windrush children were suffering and they pushed in under the table. I\u2019m appalled.\u201d\n\nShe said she had had no idea that other people were suffering in the same way that she was. \u201cIt\u2019s good more people are standing up and saying this is what is happening to me. Before they were too scared to anything, now they are standing up for their rights.\u201d\n\nJudy Griffith, 63, who flew from Barbados in 1963 when she was nine, said she was sceptical of the government\u2019s commitment to resolving this. \u201cI am concerned it will end up like the Grenfell fire. The government is making promises which then get forgotten once the interest dies down, and the whole thing gets swept under the carpet.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe promise of compensation came as it was revealed that the number of people who had contacted the Home Office\u2019s helpline set up to offer support for members of the Windrush generation had risen to 232. The first four people whose cases have gone to a dedicated team of officials have been given permanent residence status.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diane Abbott attends the protest in Windrush Square, Brixton Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nLater, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, addressed a Windrush rally in Brixton, south London, telling them that the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and May, should not be apologising over the scandal. \u201cYou know why?

President Trump appointed Liu in July 2017.\n\n\u201cWe were advised of the referral within the past few weeks,\u201d McCabe\u2019s counsel, Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general, said in a statement. \u201cAlthough we believe the referral is unjustified, the standard for an IG referral is very low. We have already met with staff members from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\nBromwich added, \u201cWe are confident that, unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the administration, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute.\u201d\n\nDOJ WATCHDOG SENDS CRIMINAL REFERRAL FOR MCCABE TO FEDERAL PROSECUTOR\n\nMcCabe, the former FBI deputy director, is not alone in facing IG problems. It emerged Friday that even Comey is the subject of an IG review over his handling of classified information in memos he penned. But McCabe faces greater risk now that the findings of his case have been referred to the U.S. attorney.\n\nLiu is a Republican and has a long history of political donations to GOP candidates, according to Open Secrets political donation records, but it does not appear that she donated to Trump.\n\nLiu was criticized during her Senate confirmation hearing last year when it was revealed that she met with Trump at least once while being considered for the post \u2014 an unprecedented step in the process for potential U.S. attorney nominees.\n\nBut whether Liu will opt to prosecute McCabe is unclear. Referrals do not guarantee that charges will be brought, nor do they require prosecutors to act in any way.\n\nOfficials from the Justice Department, the inspector general\u2019s office and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office all declined to comment on the referral.\n\nAccording to Federal Code 18 USC 1001, someone prosecuted for making false statements could face a fine and/or up to five years imprisonment.\n\nFormer high-ranking Justice Department official James Trusty, who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told Fox News that prosecution was unlikely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty unusual territory for a false-statement prosecution to be based on employment actions, like lying to your inspector general,\u201d Trusty told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual setting to have a false-statement prosecution because typically they\u2019re associated with independent criminal probes. This is an employment probe.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, who last month was invited to join President Trump\u2019s outside legal team but withdrew himself after a conflict of interest, said he thinks a prosecution is inevitable.\n\n\u201cThis is a senior FBI official. He lied under oath to FBI and Justice Department officials at least three times,\u201d diGenova told Fox News Friday.\n\nThe IG sent the referral Thursday after he found that McCabe leaked a self-serving story to the press and later lied about it to then-FBI Director Comey and federal investigators, prompting Attorney General Jeff Sessions to fire him just days before his pension was set to become effective.\n\nThe initial investigation into McCabe was ordered by Comey. While the former FBI chief may not have intentionally been after his deputy, he was looking for the source of a leak to The Wall Street Journal in an Oct. 30, 2016, story confirming a bureau investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHorowitz found that McCabe lacked \u201ccandor\u201d when questioned by FBI agents on multiple occasions, and that he wrongly told agents he did not authorize the disclosure and did not know who was responsible.\n\nMCCABE 'UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED' OVER COMEY COMMENTS\n\nBromwich blasted the Horowitz report, and said that it failed to \u201cadequately address the evidence.\u201d He suggested that the inspector general's office should \u201ccredit Mr. McCabe\u2019s account over Director Comey\u2019s.\u201d\n\nComey has maintained McCabe did not tell him about the leak.\n\nTrusty, weighing the odds of prosecution, said that making false statements in the context of an \u201cadministrative interview\u201d is \u201cless sexy to prosecutors than a false statement during a criminal investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that said, it\u2019s a crap shoot,\u201d Trusty said.\n\n\"They are prosecuting Michael Flynn for doing the same thing,\" diGenova noted.\n\nHowever, Mueller\u2019s team, which is probing Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, is prosecuting former national security adviser Flynn after he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI as part of a criminal investigation \u2014 not an inspector general investigation.\n\n\u201cIt is Liu\u2019s job to take this up, and it\u2019s got nothing to do with Trump,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cThe Justice Department and the inspector general sent it to her, not because she\u2019s a Trump appointee, but because she is the U.S. attorney.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think he will be prosecuted.\u201d", "link": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/04/20/mccabes-fate-rests-with-trump-appointed-prosecutor.html", "published": "2018-04-20T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Anthony Bourdain slams Alec Baldwin's take on #MeToo movement: 'Just shut up'", "text": "Anthony Bourdain opened up about the #MeToo movement and shared some advice for actor and comedian, Alec Baldwin.\n\n\u201cJust shut up,\" Bourdain advised the Hollywood actor when asked by the Daily Beast about their 2017 Twitter spat over Bourdain's girlfriend and Harvey Weinstein accuser Asia Argento.\n\n\u201cWhen someone you care about and respect, you see them struggle to go on the record\u2014the incredible difficulty of going public about something, and the very real peril at the time\u2014it changes you,\u201d Bourdain said of Argento accusing Weinstein of sexual assault. \"When Asia spoke to Ronan [Farrow], I think she might have been the first to go on record knowing with absolute certainty that she would most likely be sued, destroyed, crushed by this gigantic machine that had for decades been crushing far more powerful people than her who dared speak up. But she did it anyway. So to see that, and to see the blowback in Italy where she\u2019s received no support, has been eye-opening.\"\n\nJust as the Weinstein scandal was starting to dominate headlines late last year, Argento called out Baldwin after he appeared on PBS Newshour and criticized Weinstein victim Rose McGowan, for setting with the disgraced movie mogul.\n\nArgento took to Twitter and said, \"Hey @AlecBaldwin you're either a complete moron or providing cover for your pals and saving your own rep. Maybe all three.\"\n\nBaldwin replied to Argento and wrote, \"If you paint every man w the same brush, you\u2019re gonna run out of paint or men.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't long before Bourdain stepped in to defend his girlfriend. The TV host lashed back at Baldwin and said, \"You are really too dumb to pour piss out of a boot.\"\n\nFollowing the Twitter beef, Bourdain cooked dinner for three of Weinstein\u2019s accusers: Argento, McGowan and Annabella Sciorra.\n\n\u201cAs importantly,\u201d Bourdain continues, \u201cthe other women that started talking to Asia\u2014sometimes in my presence\u2014I started hearing a lot of things and seeing a lot of things that I had been blind to before, and had not heard before.\n\n\"I would love to tell you that I had all along been enlightened, but I was not.
