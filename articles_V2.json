The Ocean Agency/XL Catlin Seaview Survey\n\n\"There's huge trouble in paradise,\" said Craig Downs, a biologist who studies dying coral in Hawaii.\n\nAt the Great Barrier Reef \u2014 considered one of the Earth's largest living structures \u2014 about half of the coral died in 2016 and 2017 because of record extreme heat, a result of climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers found.\n\nHistorically, coral deaths were at a smaller 5 percent to 10 percent.\n\nOther research has estimated that 90 percent of the world's corals could be dead as soon as 2050.\n\nAustralia's weather bureau said 2017 was the country's third-hottest year on record, and the scorching temperatures came despite the lack of an El Ni\u00f1o system that normally brings warmer weather.\n\nScientists are concerned that the colonies of coral that make up the Great Barrier Reef have been damaged to a point where they won't bounce back. If corals remain in too-warm water they turn white \u2014 a process known as bleaching \u2014 and can potentially die.\n\nA severely bleached branching coral sits amid minimally bleached boulder coral.

They normally seek out cooler waters to sit with their eggs, but this rocky outcrop is crosscrossed with hot thermal vents. The large gathering is also unusual\u00e2\u0080\u0094these octopuses are normally solitary, and occasionally cannibalistic.

(See our most beautiful octopus pictures.)\n\nWith Voigt's help, Hartwell identified the plentiful cephalopods as part of the genus Muusoctopus\u00e2\u0080\u0094and possibly even a species new to science. These octopuses are solitary and occasionally cannibalistic.\n\nBut first, she had to figure out why they were there\u00e2\u0080\u0094and why had so many of them gathered in such a small area.\n\nRocky Real Estate\n\nIt's likely because the Dorado Outcrop is valuable egg-laying real estate, Hartwell discovered.\n\nOctopuses 101 How many hearts does an octopus have?

(Read about another deep-sea creature that lays its eggs on hydrothermal vents.)\n\n\"There were so many of them there that at first I thought they were all really happy,\" Hartwell says.\n\nAs Hartwell and Voight scrutinized the Alvin footage, however, they noticed something strange. None of the eggs were developing, and all the mothers showed signs of severe stress.\n\nLong-Suffering Moms\n\nAccording to octopus expert Jennifer Mather, who wasn't involved in the study, the water in the crevices is likely just too hot for the deep-sea invertebrates.\n\nBut with so few places to lay their eggs, the mothers have little choice but to endure the sweltering conditions, Hartwell and colleagues conclude in their study, published recently in the journal Deep-Sea Research Part I.\n\n\"This study reminds us that the deep sea is not a uniform environment. There are lots of different microhabitats for life to exploit,\" says Mather, of Alberta's University of Lethbridge.\n\nIt's also possibly not that surprising, considering making sacrifices is nothing new to octopuses.

The crew from NOAA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Okeanos Explorer filmed the unusual squid with their remote submarine, thousands of feet beneath the surface. For now, biologists must speculate on the creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anatomy and behavior.\n\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, a strange creature lurks in the deep: a blood-red squid with stubby arms, missing tentacles, and a knack for swimming like a nautilus.\n\nThe unusual squid, which might or might not be a new species, was filmed on April 17 by the crew of the Okeanos Explorer, a research vessel run by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nBut on April 17, researchers got a surprise: Thousands of feet beneath the surface in the western Gulf of Mexico, the Okeanos Explorer's remote-controlled submarine spotted a creature that, at first, didn't resemble a squid at all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou get a lot of octopuses that are sitting on the ground and being adorable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says squid biologist Sarah McAnulty, a Ph.D. student at the University of Connecticut. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one looks more like a vampire squid in color, but then it has this completely bizarre body pattern that just totally bowled me over. It almost looks like a nautilus in the way it's swimming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy first reaction was, 'What in the hell was that?',\u00e2\u0080\u009d says NOAA biologist Mike Vecchione, a squid expert featured on the live Okeanos feed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn't look like any squid I had seen, until we started getting close and the animal started rotating around.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVecchione and McAnulty say that it's too soon to say what the mystery squid is. Perhaps it's a new species, but Vecchione is currently checking whether the mystery squid is Discoteuthis discus, a squid species known from fragments collected in trawls throughout the tropical Atlantic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time we catch [D. discus], it's so hard to tell what species it is. I've never seen one entire, or in good condition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Vecchione. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that's what it is, then it's the first time anybody's seen one alive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA Deepening Mystery\n\nThe submarine didn't collect the squid, so for now, biologists must speculate on the creature's anatomy and behavior. What does the squid eat? Does it bioluminesce, like many deep-sea creatures? And what's with the animal's strange posture?\n\nPerhaps the unfamiliar submarine spooked the squid into scrunching up: Researchers say that it's not unheard of for a squid to adopt a similar posture as a form of defense. However, this mystery squid stands out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one was real extreme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Vecchione. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA couple of the arms were folded right flat on the back, and a couple were folded underneath, and a couple were sticking out to the side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMcAnulty suggests that beyond defense, the squid's posture could help it collect \u00e2\u0080\u009cmarine snow\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the detritus from shallower waters that many deep-sea creatures depend on for food.\n\nSome squids, such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid, have sticky skin that allows them to collect marine snow on their outstretched bodies. Perhaps the squid's arms help harvest marine snow, or help prevent the nutritive schmutz from flowing off the creature's body as it swims?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would be a really bizarre approach to surviving,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says McAnulty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is total conjecture, but it seems plausible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMcAnulty and Vecchione say that future dives may reveal more details. Vecchione wants to see the animal's underside, while McAnulty wants to see them film the creature without lights, to check whether the squid bioluminesces.\n\nBoth agree that the squid will hardly be the last surprise awaiting marine biologists."}, {"link": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/features/sunscreen-destroying-coral-reefs-alternatives-travel-spd.html", "title": "Here Are Some Alternatives to Reef-Damaging Sunscreen", "text": "View Images A snorkeler with schooling smallmouth grunt at Champagne Beach.\n\nPhotograph by Jad Davenport, National Geographic Creative\n\nFrom a distance, Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Great Barrier Reef is an underwater gem. The reef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s colorful corals serve as a submerged garden for a vibrant marine ecosystem that draws visitors to the area from all over the world. Snorkelers and scuba-divers alike can swim alongside some of the thousands of species of fish that make the reef their home. Lucky travelers might even catch a glimpse of the ecosystem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dugongs or sea turtles.\n\nBut the ecosystem is fragile. Rising temperatures and harmful chemicals leaching into the water are bleaching the once-thriving reef. Human visitors might even be carrying some of these toxins on their skin.\n\nWhen you swim with sunscreen on, chemicals like oxybenzone can seep into the water, where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re absorbed by corals. These substances can disrupt coral\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproduction and growth cycles, ultimately leading to bleaching. Even if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go swimming after applying sunscreen, it can still go down drains when you shower. Aerosol can often spray large amounts of sunscreen onto sand, where it gets washed into our oceans.\n\nHumans might be responsible for this contamination, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also capable of helping heal these fragile underwater ecosystems. (Related: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Bright Idea Could Save the Biggest Reef on Earth\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n\nAt-Risk Reefs\n\nCoral reefs all over the world are threatened by pollution, and many of the most popular destination spots have the most at-risk coral. In addition to the Great Barrier Reef, heavy human traffic in the bays of Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Israel are especially vulnerable.\n\nOahu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hanauma Bay, a state park that was formed within a volcanic cone, is one such example. The area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turquoise surf and vibrant coral gardens draw nearly 1 million tourists each year, making the spot one of Hawaii\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best places for snorkeling. The bay is home to 450 species of fish and has the largest mass of reef anywhere in Oahu.\n\nHurricane Hole at the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, located off Saint John, is another popular spot. The submersed monument protects 22 miles of marine habitat, including 30 out of the 45 known coral species. Here, visitors can snorkel in the mangroves with coral, fish, and marine invertebrates.\n\nThe Final Show: Cuba's Coral Reefs\n\nIsrael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular Eilat Coral Beach Nature Reserve is another example. The Gulf of Eilat houses the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only coral reefs, which are a major draw for tourists. Bridges built over top of the reefs allow visitors to get a peek at the coral and colorful fish it houses. Scuba divers can also dive along the front and slope of the reef for a more intimate view.\n\nIf we lose coral reefs, we will have lost a vital ecosystem. We could also hurt our global economy\u00e2\u0080\u0094coral reefs are a major tourist attraction and source of income for these popular vacation spots. (Related: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow One Country Is Restoring Its Damaged Ocean\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n\nSteps for Reef Safety\n\nHawaii has taken steps to ban sunscreen that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not safe for coral, and lawmakers will vote on it at the end of the month. The bill could go into effect by July 2019.\n\nBut governments don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want people to stop using sunscreen all together, due to risks of burns and skin cancer. The good news is there are alternatives that are safer\u00e2\u0080\u0094for people and for coral\u00e2\u0080\u0094that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include oxybenzone.\n\nHaereticus Environmental Lab publishes a list each year of what sunscreens are safe for the environment, and organizations like the Environmental Working Group also publish a safe sunscreen guide. Mineral-based sunblocks that use titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are safer than the oxybenzone-containing alternatives. Sunscreens with \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-nano\u00e2\u0080\u009d size particles are safer because they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be ingested by corals. Some sunscreens have a combination of nano-size and non-nano size particles, and the Consumer Products Inventory has a database that can tell you if your sunscreen contains nanoparticles.\n\nSome tour companies in popular destinations like Mexico make it mandatory for visitors to wear only biodegradable sunscreen. Select Hawaiian resorts give out free reef-safe sunscreen samples that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain harmful chemicals. Many of these resorts will let patrons know of these restrictions in advance or list it on their websites."}, {"link": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-sharks-spiders-birds-beetles.html", "title": "This Beetle Can Withstand 40 Times More G-Force Than a Fighter Pilot", "text": "View Images An eastern eyed click beetle rests on a leaf in the eastern United States.\n\nPhotograph by Skip Moody, Alamy\n\nMany primates are natural acrobats, like the tree-hopping gibbon, the swinging orangutan, and even some humans (hello, Cirque du Soleil!)\n\nBut the animal kingdom is full of unsung aerialists that perform amazing airborne feats\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes with no feets at all.\n\nRays\n\nMany rays in the Mobula genus, which dwell in tropical oceans, have graceful movements.

For modern-day storm chasers like Tim Samaras, who received several grants from the National Geographic Society and is the hero of Brantley Hargrove\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Man Who Caught the Storm, tornadoes exert a similar sense of wonder and awe. Chasing violent, meteorological events across the Great Plains, these derring-doers frequently risk their lives to get close to a tornado and help scientists understand what makes them tick.\n\nWhen National Geographic caught up with the author at his home in Dallas, Texas, Hargrove explained why Tim Samaras was much more than just a storm chaser; why the Great Plains are the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premier breeding ground for tornadoes; and why the storm that eventually killed Samaras was so deadly.\n\nView Images Photograph Courtesy Simon & Schuster Publicity\n\nAt the center of your book is a man named Tim Samaras. Give us a brief biographical profile and explain how he became a storm chaser.\n\nTim was not the guy you would have pegged to get the kind of data scientists have been trying and failing to get for decades. He was this middle-class guy born and raised in Lakewood, Colorado, grew up a bit of a tinkerer. He was always taking apart his mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appliances and conducting little experiments in his bedroom. During a thunderstorm he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d run a line out to a power pole outside to see if he could conduct a little bit of the charge to a light bulb. Or he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tune the radio during storms and listen for the static crashes of far-off lightning. He was fascinated by storms.\n\nWhat got him interested in storm chasing was a NOVA documentary on twisters. He saw scientists like Howie Bluestein going out after storms in an attempt to deploy a probe into the core of a tornado. Tim was transfixed by the image of these guys tracking these storms down, then racing down dirt roads trying to head them off. He wanted to do that. He wanted to become a chaser.\n\nYou write, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil recently, the core of a tornado remained as remote as the surface of the sun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Take us inside a twister and explain why Tim Samaras\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cturtle\u00e2\u0080\u009d was such an important innovation.\n\nScientists have been trying, and failing, for decades to get data from the core of a violent tornado. As you can imagine, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extremely dangerous place. In high-end tornadoes, winds can be in excess of 200 mph, with hurtling debris capable of skewering telephone poles. Tornadoes are also a transitory occurrence. You can see hurricanes coming days ahead. With tornadoes, we often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to come down 10 minutes before, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely hard to get data.\n\nIn the 90s, you had the Vortex Project, a multi-million-dollar, federally funded moon shot-like effort to understand tornadoes. They got a probe closer than anybody had by that point, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the heart of the tornado. So, here comes Tim, against this backdrop of scientists with PhDs from the ivory towers of meteorology and academia, and he had invented this \u00e2\u0080\u009cturtle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is essentially an instrument package, which he made from a shell of milled steel. Conical in shape, about 6 inches tall and 20 inches across, it is roughly the size of a sedan tire and can withstand the flow field of a violent tornado. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an activating switch on the back; you put it in the dirt, get the hell out of the way, and come back once the tornado has gone past and collect your instrument.\n\nYou write, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the United States, the damage caused by tornadoes has outstripped that of fires, earthquakes, and floods.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Explain why the Great Plains are the best breeding ground in the world for tornadoes.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, tornadoes are the largest causes of economic damage in terms of destruction, except for hurricanes. The 2011 outbreak of tornadoes in Dixie Alley caused at least $27 billion in damage and something like 360 deaths. The Great Plains is an accident of geography. Almost nowhere else in the world do you have this unstable moist air mass out of the Gulf of Mexico meeting the drier air mass coming over the Rockies, along with cold polar air coming out of the North. We just happen to have a kind of geography where we have all these different air masses colliding to form more than 1,000 tornadoes per year. Our closest runner-up in the sheer number of tornadoes is Canada, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even close.\n\nTo place one of his probes, Samaras had to get as close as 500 yards to a tornado. Talk about the tension between caution and danger, and how Samaras \u00e2\u0080\u009cmade history\u00e2\u0080\u009d in South Dakota.\n\nTim had always been a pretty cautious chaser, but he realized that to get an instrument into the core of a tornado you had to play a little closer to what I call \u00e2\u0080\u009cno man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d First, you have to get in front of a tornado, which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. They move at various speeds up to 40 mph, and they swerve, so you have to get really close to be sure your instrument is going to enter the core. It was a gamble he had to make time and time again.\n\nHe finally got it right in South Dakota, the titan of the plains. The Manchester, South Dakota, F4 was the largest and most violent tornado he had been confronted with. He hauls down this dirt road with the tornado closing in. He can see debris going up into the funnel, taking houses along the way. Pat Porter, the guy with him, is clearly nervous, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTim, please hurry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You can hear the fear in his voice. Tim jumps out, activates the probe, plants it in the dirt, then sprints back into the vehicle and peels out as fast as he can with this tornado dropping pieces of housing insulation into the road ahead. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it then, but he had achieved what atmospheric scientists had been trying and failing to do for decades. His probe went into the core of an F4 tornado. It was a huge day.\n\nCaught in Tornado Alley Scientist Karen Kosiba goes into the eye of the storm to investigate the 2011 tornado season.\n\nStorm chasers are a special breed. Take us inside this arcane fraternity and discuss the paradox between their high-fiving glee and the death and destruction tornadoes cause.\n\nTornado chasers come from all walks of life. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met a number of them and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to find any singular demographic except, as you say, they are mostly men. The only thing they have in common is that they go out chasing one day and get bit by the bug. It is very much an addictive pursuit. But contrary to the depiction you see in the movie Twister, a lot of it is quite boring. For a week at a time you can drive thousands of miles just to see a thunderstorm that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t produce.\n\nIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until my third outing as a chaser that we saw a peerless tornado event in Pilgrim, Nebraska. There is definitely a moral conundrum that goes on, because later I found out we were very near a village that was almost completely destroyed. The damage looked like scenes from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nTim finally met the ultimate storm he had been chasing near El Reno, Oklahoma, in 2013. Talk us through the events of that day, and explain why Samaras couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t outrun this storm.\n\nThe El Reno tornado of 2013 was purpose-built to kill chasers, and Tim was not the only chaser to run into serious trouble that day. Tim and his team were driving a sedan, which was unusual. Usually, Tim would be in a large GMC diesel 4 x 4. They had three probes in the back of this sedan, which was carrying Tim, his son Paul, and his chase partner, Carl Young.\n\nAll the indicators that day were for something big, and this tornado quickly grew to immense proportions. They were south of this little town, El Reno, for the most part on dirt roads. The first link in the chain that would eventually bind them was that they were going to make this east turn, but realized it was going to lead them into dead end, and they would be out of the chase. This forced them to drive closer to the tornado than they would have preferred.\n\nDebris was bouncing off of the sedan and Tim and Carl were well aware that this was a very bad place to be. So they made a north turn on the next dirt road that they could. About the time they got to U.S. Highway 81, the tornado was outpacing them, moving faster and faster, and getting bigger and bigger, until it was around two miles in width.\n\nIt was the worst kind of tornado to intercept. It was rain-wrapped, with a curtain of rain hanging to the north, so they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it for the most part. It was eventually moving at highway speeds, which is incredibly dangerous. And what they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see, is that the tornado is beginning to hook toward them. Eventually, the rain curtains overtake them and they encounter increasing headwind speeds of 100-plus mph. But it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until close to the end that Tim understands how precarious their position is. The sedan is not capable of handling the extremely wet roads and high winds while carrying three grown men and three steel probes. So, eventually, their progress slows to about 20 mph. At this point, they are well within the core of the tornado.\n\nThe core is probably survivable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when they encounter the sub-vortex within the tornado that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re killed. The sub-vortex fluctuates in width and has winds up to 200 mph in speed. It was a killing, lethal wind, which probably caught them by surprise. The sub-vortex slammed into their vehicle, picked it up, and its counterclockwise winds carried it northeast and deposited it in a field more than 600 feet from their starting location. Tim, his son, Paul, and his chasing partner, Carl, were all killed, probably instantly.\n\nClimate change is affecting the frequency and strength of tornadoes. Unpack the science for us.\n\nThe science regarding climate change and tornadoes is still a little unclear. The emerging consensus is that climate change will have two impacts on the tornadoes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 main sources of fuel. With the warming of the oceans we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have a higher evaporation rate, more moisture released into the air, which is a primary food source for tornadoes. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also research that seems to indicate that there may actually be a decrease in windsheer, which is another primary energy source for tornadoes. Tornadoes can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t survive with unidirectional winds. They need converging winds. So climate change may lead to a lower number of tornadoes. But when tornadoes do occur, these outbursts may be much, much worse than anything we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen.\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end with Tim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy. Was he just a super-talented storm chaser? Or did he have a lasting impact on the scientific understanding of tornadoes?\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inarguable that he had a lasting impact. He showed that we can get data from the core of a violent tornado and that was a huge step. Others are now following in his footsteps, like Joshua Wurman at the Center for Severe Weather Research, who is now actively going out there and deploying instruments of his own design into the cores of tornadoes. He hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a direct strike yet, like Tim had, but he is working on it.\n\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity."}, {"link": "https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/earth-day-then-now-history-science-spd.html", "title": "How the Environment Has Changed Since the First Earth Day", "text": "View Images Ash spews from a coal-fueled power plant.\n\nPhotograph by Emory Kristof, National Geographic\n\nWhen Earth Day was first created in 1970, it rode the coattails of a decade filled with social activism. Voting rights were strengthened, civil rights were outlined, and women were demanding equal treatment.\n\nBut there was no Environmental Protection Agency, no Clean Air Act, or Clean Water Act.\n\nFast forward 48 years and what started as a grassroots movement has exploded into an international day of attention and activism dedicated to preserving the environment. Officially, the United Nations recognizes this upcoming April 22 as International Mother Earth Day.\n\nAcross the globe, millions of people take part in Earth Day. According to the Earth Day Network, one of the largest activist bodies organizing Earth Day events, people celebrate by holding marches, planting trees, meeting with local representatives, and cleaning up their local environments.\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nA series of critical environmental issues helped birth the modern environmental movement. Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring published in 1962. It brought to light the dangerous use of a pesticide called DDT that was polluting rivers and destroying the eggs of birds of prey like bald eagles.\n\nWhen the modern environmental movement was at its genesis, pollution was in plain sight. White birds turned black from soot. Smog was thick. Recycling was nascent.\n\nThen, in 1969, a large oil spill struck the coast of Santa Barbara, California. It moved then-Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin to put Earth Day on the national stage. More than 20 million people turned out.\n\nIt spurred a movement that pushed then-President Nixon to create the Environmental Protection Agency. In the 48 years since the first Earth Day, there have been more than 48 major environmental wins. Protections have been put in place on everything from clean water to endangered species.\n\nThe EPA also works to protect human health. For example, lead and asbestos, once common in homes and offices, have been largely phased out of many common products.\n\nToday\n\nThe theme of 2018's Earth Day celebration is plastics\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically how to decrease their unwanted impacts on our environment. What was perhaps set in place in the mid-20th century when plastic was manufactured on a large scale has come back to haunt us.\n\nPlastic refuse is everywhere. It's bigger than Texas in the Pacific garbage patch, and it's as small as the micro plastics getting eaten by fish and churned out on our dinner plates.\n\nSome environmental groups are leading grassroots movements to cut back on the use of common plastics like straws; the U.K. even recently proposed passing a law to ban them. It's one incremental way to cut back on the whopping 91 percent of plastic that isn't recycled.\n\nAnd it's not just plastic imperiling the Earth. Today's worst environmental issues are seemingly a culmination of all the groundwork laid over the past two hundred years.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe two most pressing issues we face today are habitat loss and climate change, and these issues are interrelated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Jonathan Baillie, chief scientist of the National Geographic Society.\n\nClimate change has been called a threat to biodiversity and national security. Studies have linked it to the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef and abnormal weather.\n\nUnlike the first Earth Day, 2018's celebration exists in a world with a more robust regulatory framework to enact environmental policy and regulate our impact.\n\nWhether that framework will stay intact is now a matter of debate. (See a running list of how the Trump administration is changing the environment.)\n\nBaillie noted that addressing these issues requires fundamental changes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, we need to place greater value on the natural world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\n\nThen, we need to commit to protecting regions like the Amazon and Congo that house critical environments. Lastly, he notes, we need to innovate more rapidly. Producing protein for consumption more efficiently and cultivating renewable energy resources will help reduce the impacts of what he sees as the Earth's greatest threats."}, {"link": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2018/04/most-compelling-photos-of-earth.html", "title": "The Most Compelling Photos of Earth", "text": "Every day, we publish online world-class photography from around the world.

He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly when he was just nine years old about the inaction he saw from adults who were supposed to be preserving the planet for future generations.\n\nRealizing that he and his peers would be living through the consequences of their passivity, Finkbeiner started the environmental group Plant-for-the-Planet, which then partnered with the UN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Billion Tree campaign. Together, they have set a new planting goal of one trillion trees, or about 150 trees for every person on Earth.\n\nA Man in India Planted a Forest Bigger Than Central Park\n\nFunded in part by Kickstarter, \"Forest Man\" was directed by William Douglas McMaster and won Best Documentary for the American Pavilion Emerging Filmmaker Showcase at the Cannes Film Festival in 2014.

He introduced peaches, avocados, mangoes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and came up with the idea for bringing Japanese cherry trees to America.\n\nAfter seeing the trees in Japan and becoming enchanted by their beauty, Fairchild ordered some for his home near Chevy Chase, Maryland. So many people came to see the trees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first bloom the following year that he gifted 300 of them to the city of Chevy Chase.\n\nAs Congress worked to beautify Washington, D.C., which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t considered to be an attractive city at the time, Fairchild (along with folks like Eliza Scidmore) supported the popular idea that cherry trees could be planted around city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tidal Basin. With support from President and Mrs. Taft, who had just entered the White House and were looking for a way to build up diplomatic relations with Japan, thousands of trees were ordered.\n\nThe first attempt at shipping the trees failed because they were poorly packed and full of infestation. The second attempt succeeded, and the blossoms are still welcomed with joy every spring in D.C. over a hundred years later.\n\nVillagers in Georgia Risk Their Lives for Christmas Trees\n\nNordmann firs, Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferred Christmas trees, grow in the forested valleys of Racha, a mountainous region of Georgia. But the process of harvesting the seeds from them is more akin to the Wild West than a holiday tradition.\n\nThe people who live in nearby villagers climb high up into the fir trees without equipment, often endangering their own lives during the fast-paced harvest, to gather the pinecones that grow at the top. The pinecones, which contain the firs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 seeds, are then shipped in big batches to companies that grow new trees for the Christmas season.\n\nEven the highest paid laborers only make 90 cents per pound of Nordmann fir seeds, while the lowest make 16 cents per pound. In addition, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccone pirates\u00e2\u0080\u009d poach these valuable cones away from the company laborers.\n\nWhile the climbers use the opportunity to make a small amount of money, critics say the safety of those harvesting the seeds needs to be a greater priority.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think that [Christmas] is about the birth of Jesus Christ and people are dying to get the Christmas tree into your living rooms, this is really insane,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adds Michael Kraus, the German safety coordinator and harvest manager for Fair Trees.\n\nOne Man Plans to Transform London Into One Big Park\n\nView Images The oldest of the city's eight Royal Parks, St. James's Park offers lovely views.\n\nPhotograph by Simon Roberts, National Geographic Creative\n\nNational Geographic explorer and self-described \u00e2\u0080\u009cguerrilla photographer\u00e2\u0080\u009d Daniel Raven-Ellison isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily planting trees himself.

Environmental group Earth Day Network estimates that as many as one billion people around the world celebrate Earth Day in some way. Unsure how you can get in on the action? Below are just some of the few ways you can participate.\n\nDitch Your Plastic\n\nThis year, Earth Day Network is putting the spotlight on plastic pollution. Plastic is pervasive, and it's more than a water bottle or two thrown on the sidewalk. The garbage patch the size of Texas meandering through the Pacific? It's made of 1.8 trillion tons of plastic and about 94 percent of that is microplastic. Those bit-sized pieces of plastic are found throughout the ocean, and can even end up on your plate.\n\nThe Earth Day Network has created a toolkit that helps you calculate your plastic use and create a plan to cut down on consumption.\n\nYou can start with easy steps like ditching your straw.\n\nPlant a Tree\n\nTrees play an important role in balancing our ecosystem by absorbing carbon. They can even help reduce the impacts of climate change by pulling greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.\n\nThe organization One Tree Planted organizes meet-ups for people to plant trees together, but if you don't see your region represented, you can easily sign up to stage your own event. Earth Day Network also organizes tree-planting groups in urban areas and schools or allows you to donate.\n\nGo Local\n\nLocal communities are at the front lines of keeping their towns green. Online platforms like Eventbrite and Facebook can help you find Earth Day events in your own town. Many cities hold gatherings like festivals, marches, talks, or concerts to help stoke that Earth Day fervor.\n\nAnd, of course, you can always let your representatives in Congress know where your priorities are by writing to them.\n\nCelebrate Through Song\n\nHow do you write a classical music score for the Earth? These composers tackled the challenge for National Geographic's Symphony for Our World event.\n\nSymphony for Our World pairs stunning natural images with a symphonic composition by Bleeding Fingers Music. On Earth Day, the Nat Geo WILD channel will air an hour-long special at 7p.m. EST/6p.m. CST.

Johnson, the first Black heavyweight champion, was convicted in 1913 under the Mann Act, U.S. federal legislation that made it illegal to cross state lines with a woman \u201cfor the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\u201d Jim Crow-era prosecutors often used the legislation as a type of anti-miscegenation law. In a tweet, Trump said Johnson\u2019s \u201ctrials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!\u201d Johnson was widely despised for flaunting his title, his wealth and his affection for white women. He was convicted by an all-white jury. Johnson spent seven years abroad as a fugitive before returning to the United States and turning himself in. He served about a year in federal prison. Congressional leaders have sought a pardon for Johnson for years. A bill requesting a pardon from George W. Bush passed the House of Representatives in 2008 but died in the Senate.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nA 1,000-page education bill in 2015 included a provision requesting a pardon for Johnson. It called the boxer a \u201cflamboyant, defiant, and controversial figure in the history of the United States who challenged racial biases.\u201d Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and former senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, along with New York Congressmen Peter King, a Republican, and Gregory Meeks, a Democrat, requested a pardon from president Barack Obama in 2016. John Arthur \u201cJack\u201d Johnson, nicknamed the \u201cGalveston Giant\u201d in the ring, was born in 1878 southeast of Houston. By 1903, he became the unofficial \u201cNegro heavyweight champion.\u201d World heavyweight champion Jim Jeffries refused to fight him and instead retired. But in 1910, Johnson gained the championship belt, and Jeffries emerged from retirement to \u201creclaim the heavyweight championship for the white race.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff, it\u2019s up to you,\u201d novelist Jack London wrote before the bout, according to NPR. \u201cThe White Man must be rescued.\u201d Instead, Johnson pummelled Jeffries for 15 rounds in \u201cthe battle of the century\u201d and won the belt outright. \u201cI could never have whipped Johnson at my best,\u201d Jeffries later said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have hit him. No, I couldn\u2019t have reached him in 1,000 years.\u201d The Mann Act was signed just weeks prior, though, and federal investigators almost immediately began looking into Johnson\u2019s romantic life. He married a white woman, Etta Terry Duryea, in 1911, but their relationship was rocky and she committed suicide a year later. Three months after that, he married Lucille Cameron, who was also white. Her mother was so disgusted with the relationship, she claimed that Cameron had been kidnapped, but Cameron refused to co-operate with investigators. But law enforcement agents found Belle Schreiber, a Chicago prostitute with whom Johnson had an affair years earlier. She agreed to testify against the boxer in 1913, and an all-white jury took less than two hours to convict him. He skipped bail after the trial and travelled Europe and South America with Cameron before surrendering to U.S. agents at the Mexican border in 1920. He served a one-year prison term in Leavenworth, Kansas, and returned to find that society and the ring that wouldn\u2019t accept him. Before his incarceration, Johnson was known to prance around the ring with swagger. He owned a nightclub and wore gold teeth. He once reportedly purchased a pet leopard and took it for walks while sipping champagne. But by 1921, he was past his prime, and boxing instituted a stricter colour barrier. It would be 16 more years until Joe Louis defeated James Braddock in Chicago to win the world heavyweight title. Johnson fought, often for private audiences as celebrity appearances, until age 67 in 1945. He died a year later in a car wreck in North Carolina, speeding from a restaurant that refused him service.\n\nRead more about:"}, {"link": "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/why-everyone-is-talking-about-netflixs-sex-cult-documentary-wild-wild-country/news-story/4b47885b1f12e08e1112a3eb2c539967", "title": "Netflix \u2018sex cult\u2019 doco everyone\u2019s talking about", "text": "Netflix\u2019s hit show Stranger Things is returning for a new season.

Producer Shawn Levy said that everyone is back to work THIS month to start filming. Are you excitedly waiting for the premiere of the third season? Any idea on what will happen? Let us know in the comments below!\n\nStranger Things Season 3: Everything You NEED To Know About Upcoming Season! 2:13\n\nNETFLIX\u2019S latest hit show is loopy. It\u2019s bananas. And stunningly, it\u2019s all true.\n\nThe documentary Wild Wild Country, now streaming, is making waves, and for good reason.\n\nThe six-part series tells the story of the Rajneshees, an Indian \u201csex cult\u201d whose 2000-odd members moved en masse from India to rural Oregon in the 1980s. For the 50 or so residents of the town of Antelope, mostly ranchers and retirees, the arrival of thousands of beaming orange and red-clad devotees was a total shock. What followed involved the US\u2019s largest ever bioterrorism attack, an assassination attempt and terrifyingly large gun stockpiles.\n\nTELL ME ABOUT THIS CULT\n\nBaghwhan Shree Rajnesh was an Indian guru who started to attract a following in the 1960s. He believed in peace, compassion and sexual freedom. (Riiiiight.)\n\nAbout 1968, a 16-year-old girl, Ma Anand Sheela, and her father attended one of his talks at his book-lined Mumbai apartment. As she explains, once in his presence, she was immediately filled with wonder and happiness and started following his teachings.\n\n* For more stories like this, head to Whimn\n\nAfter travelling to the US and meeting her future husband, Sheela and he returned to India and rejoined the Bagwhan, also known as Osho. After her husband\u2019s death from leukaemia, Sheela devoted herself to Bagwhan, eventually becoming his private secretary, a position of significant power and authority in the movement.\n\nThose years, in the early 70s, coincided with the explosion of interest in Eastern philosophy from Westerners. Americans, Europeans and Australians flocked to Baghwhan\u2019s ashram in the remote town of Pune and subscribed to his philosophy of meditation and free love.\n\nOK, WHAT\u2019S WITH ALL THE RED ROBES?\n\nNot sure. However, followers of the Bhagwan exclusively wear red and orange.\n\nIT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS ALL PEACE AND LOVE\n\nSort of. While the ashram grew in size, such was its popularity that travellers climbed the walls to get into the compound, the group attracted the ire of authorities and conservative Hindus. After an assassination attempt on the Bhagwan, he tried to move the community overseas.\n\nSheela was put in charge of the task and chose the 60,000-acre ranch in remote Oregon.\n\nWith architects, engineers, and town planners among their number, the followers of the Bhagwan started to build their version of a Utopian city, called Rajneeshpuram, with its own shops, airport, power grid and farms large enough to feed the entire community.\n\nFinally, after booking out the first floor deck of a Pan Am flight, the Bhagwan arrived. (In a white Rolls Royce of course. He did not believe in poverty.) Followers even shipped in peacocks and carpeted his garden for his first day.\n\nHOW DID THE TOWNSFOLK OF ANTELOPE FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS?\n\nGood question. Archival footage, which is extensively used in the series, shows the locals looking downright shocked when this stream of beatifically smiling hippies descended on their community. However, things soon turned sour and locals objected to the Rajneshees\u2019 ambitions to make their \u201ccity\u201d even larger.\n\nSheela, by now the voice of the Bhagwan who had long since taken a vow of silence, decided to move a number of Rajneshees into the town to take control of the local council via elections.\n\nFrom there things spiralled out of control in a shocking and violent way.\n\nOH BOY \u2026\n\nYep, you got it. In 1984, Sheela imported bus loads of homeless people from around the country to sway the local elections in their favour, a move which failed to work. She then orchestrated the mass salmonella poisoning of more than 700 people in a nearby, larger town by contaminating 10 salad bars with the hope this would prevent them from voting. (It is, to this day, the largest bioterror attack to have occurred in the US.)\n\nAfter a hotel owned by the Rajneshees was bombed, Sheela also began stockpiling guns for the group, and at one point, the community owned more guns than those owned by Portland\u2019s entire police force.\n\nSheela is also accused of plotting to murder the US attorney for Oregon and to bomb a courthouse along with the attempted killing of the Bhagwan\u2019s personal doctor. The following year she fled to Europe.\n\nTIME FOR THE BIG HOUSE?\n\nIndeed. In 1986, she was arrested in (what was then) West Germany and extradited to the US where she faced charges of immigration fraud and attempted murder. She was later sentenced to three 20-year sentences for what took place in Antelope.\n\nShe ultimately only served 29 months and was released on a good behaviour bond before moving to Switzerland and marrying a fellow Rajneshee.\n\nBUT THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET TRICKY\n\nWhile Sheela unquestionably committed crimes to ensure her continuing iron grip on the Rajneshees and to control the town of Antelope, Wild Wild Country paints a much more nuanced portrait of her and her motivations. The documentary explores the xenophobia and bigotry of the local community and looks at how questions about religious freedom and the fear of the unknown can make people behave terribly.\n\nWHERE IS SHEELA NOW?\n\nStill living in Switzerland where she runs two nursing homes. The Bhagwan died in 1990. However, his teachings are still published and his ashram in Pune has become the Osho International Meditation Resort which reportedly attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.\n\nSo, you might now know what happened but Wild Wild Country is still amazing viewing, given its extensive interviews with Sheela and other devotees from the US and even Australia.

Korea's denuclearization is littered with failure", "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Bill Clinton offered oil and reactors. George W. Bush mixed threats and aid. Barack Obama stopped trying after a rocket launch.\n\nWhile Seoul and Washington welcomed Pyongyang's declaration on Saturday to suspend further intercontinental ballistic missile tests and shut down its nuclear test site, the past is littered with failure.\n\nA decades-long cycle of crises, stalemates and broken promises gave North Korea the room to build up a legitimate arsenal that now includes purported thermonuclear warheads and developmental ICBMs. The North's latest announcement stopped well short of suggesting it has any intention of giving that up.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Friday to kick off a new round of high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Pyongyang. The inter-Korean summit could set up more substantial discussions between Kim and President Donald Trump, who said he plans to meet the despot he previously called \"Little Rocket Man\" in May or June.\n\nA look at previous negotiations with North Korea and how the currently planned talks between Seoul, Pyongyang and Washington took shape:\n\n___\n\n1994\n\nThe Clinton administration in October 1994 reached a major nuclear agreement with Pyongyang, ending months of war fears triggered by North Korea's threat to withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and convert its stockpile of nuclear fuel into bombs.\n\nUnder the \"Agreed Framework,\" North Korea halted construction of two reactors the United States believed were for nuclear weapons production in return for two alternative nuclear power reactors that could be used to provide electricity but not bomb fuel, and 500,000 metric tons of fuel oil annually for the North.\n\nThe deal was tested quickly. North Korea complained about delayed oil shipments and construction of the reactors, which were never delivered. The United States criticized the North's pursuit of ballistic missile capability, demonstrated in the launch of a two-stage rocket over Japan in 1998.\n\nThe Agreed Framework further lost political support in Washington with the inauguration of Bush, who in his first State of the Union address in January 2002 grouped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as parts of an \"axis of evil.\"\n\nThe deal collapsed for good months later after U.S. officials confronted North Korea over a clandestine nuclear program using enriched uranium. Washington stopped the oil shipments and Pyongyang restarted its nuclear weapons program.\n\n___\n\n2005\n\nResponding to Washington's toughened stance, North Korea announced in 2003 it obtained a nuclear device and would withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty.\n\nThis brought the United States back to the negotiating table with the North and the six-party talks also involving South Korea, China, Japan and Russia began in Beijing in August 2003.\n\nAfter months of fiery negotiations, North Korea accepted a deal in September 2005 to end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for security, economic and energy benefits.\n\nBut the agreement was shaky from the start as it came just days after the U.S. Treasury Department ordered American banks to sever relations with a Macau bank accused of helping North Korea to launder money from drug trafficking and other illicit activities, which hampered Pyongyang's international financial transactions.\n\nDisagreements between Washington and Pyongyang over the financial punishment of Banco Delta Asia temporarily derailed the six-nation talks. In October 2006, the North went on to conduct its first nuclear test detonation.\n\n___\n\n2007\n\nNorth Korea agreed to resume the disarmament talks a few weeks after the nuclear test. In February 2007, the United States and the four other nations reached an agreement to provide North Korea with an aid package worth about $400 million in return for the North disabling its nuclear facilities and re-allowing international inspectors into the country.\n\nNorth Korea demolished the cooling tower at its Nyongbyon reactor site in June 2008. But in September, the North declared it will resume reprocessing plutonium, complaining that Washington wasn't fulfilling its promise to remove the country from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nThe Bush administration removed North Korea from the list in October after the country agreed to continue disabling its nuclear plant. However, a final attempt by Bush to complete an agreement to fully dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program collapsed in December when the North refused to accept U.S.-proposed verification methods.\n\nThe six-nation talks have stalled since then. The North conducted its second nuclear test in May 2009, months after Obama took office.\n\n___\n\n2012\n\nMonths after taking power following the death of his father, current North Korean leader Kim reached a deal with the Obama administration in February 2012 to suspend nuclear weapons and missile tests and uranium enrichment and to also allow international inspectors to monitor its nuclear activities in exchange for U.S. food aid.\n\nThe United States killed the deal in April when the North launched a long-range rocket it claimed was built for delivering satellites. The failed launch was seen by the outside world as a prohibited test of ballistic missile technology.\n\nThe North criticized the United States of \"overreacting\" and launched another long-range rocket in December it said successfully delivered a satellite into space.\n\nIn 2013, Kim announced that his government would pursue a national \"byungjin\" policy aimed at simultaneously seeking nuclear development and economic growth. This was seen as a clean break from the North's previous stance that mainly used the nuclear program as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from foreign governments, rather than for immediate military purposes.\n\n___\n\n2018\n\nNorth Korea's abrupt diplomatic outreach in recent months comes after a flurry of weapons tests that marked 2017, including the underground detonation of an alleged thermonuclear warhead and three launches of developmental ICBMs designed to strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nInter-Korean dialogue resumed after Kim in his New Year's speech proposed talks with the South to reduce animosities and for the North to participate in February's Winter Olympics in Pyongchang. North Korea sent hundreds of people to the games, including Kim's sister, who expressed her brother's desire to meet with Moon for a summit. South Korean officials later brokered a potential summit between Kim and Trump.\n\nWhile South Korean and U.S. officials have said Kim is likely trying to save his broken economy from heavy sanctions, some analysts see him as entering the negotiations from a position of strength after having declared his nuclear force as complete in November last year.\n\nSeoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \"denuclearization\" that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops from the peninsula and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.\n\nSome experts say Kim's nuclear program is now too advanced to realistically expect a roll back to near zero.\n\n\"Kim will not offer CVID at the door,\" said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University who's advising Moon on his summit with Kim. He was referring to an abbreviation for the \"complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement\" of the North's nuclear weapons program.\n\n\"Everything depends on whether Trump can accept a deal that puts out the 'early fire' \u2014 taking away the North's ICBMs and freezing and closing its known nuclear and missile production facilities \u2014 and leave the rest for future negotiations,\" Koh said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kim Tong-hyung on Twitter at @KimTongHyung."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/22/gurrumuls-album-djarimirri-is-first-indigenous-language-chart-topper", "title": "Gurrumul\u2019s album Djarimirri is first Indigenous-language chart-topper", "text": "Posthumous record becomes first Indigenous-language release to reach No 1 in Australia\u2019s Aria album charts \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon\n\nGeoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu\u2019s \u201cfinal message\u201d has echoed from his beloved Yolngu country to the top of the Australian music charts \u2013 his posthumous final album now the first Indigenous-language release to be the nation\u2019s bestselling album.\n\n\n\nThe album, Djarimirri (Child of the Rainbow), a selection of songs recorded over more than four years, was released nine months after Gurrumul\u2019s death.\n\n\n\nGurrumul\u2019s daughter Jasmine Yunupingu paid tribute to her father\u2019s achievement. \u201cI would like to give a speech on behalf of my family and myself, to my father\u2019s achievement that he has had a great career,\u201d she said. \u201cFor sharing our culture through his music.

They are beginning to actively discuss among themselves whether their leader has now taken them as far as he can go, and whether there is a way of recasting Corbynism so that it does not include Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThe catalyst for this sacrilegious introspection has been seven days that have seen the implosion of Corbyn\u2019s moral, political and \u2013 crucially \u2013 parliamentary authority. What happens in the House of Commons chamber is meant to be of interest to only a small, self-obsessed Westminster clique. Maybe it is. But that clique contains some of the Labour leader\u2019s most loyal supporters. And last week they were rubbed emotionally raw by the repeated obligation to stand by their man.\n\nCorbyn appeared in the House on five major occasions. Each one was a personal catastrophe, and a tortuous trial for his allies. Twice he took to the Dispatch Box to try to hold Theresa May to account over the bombing of Syria. She destroyed him in two of her strongest performances since becoming Prime Minister. A day later he returned, to try to outflank her on her decision not to seek parliamentary support for the bombing. But in the process he tied himself in procedural knots, sowed confusion among his own MPs over which way they should vote, ended up whipping against his own motion, and still managed to lose the debate.\n\nCorbynites are beginning to actively discuss among themselves whether their leader has now taken them as far as he can go, and whether there is a way of recasting Corbynism so that it does not include Jeremy Corbyn\n\nA day later he appeared at PMQs with the Prime Minister and the Government on the ropes over the Windrush scandal. For once even moderate MPs were willing him to land a blow. Which he did. On himself. \u2018Who had ordered the destruction of the landing cards?\u2019 he asked. \u2018The last Labour government,\u2019 Mrs May responded coolly. Yet another opportunity to hold the Government to account was lost.\n\nBut the defining moment came in Tuesday\u2019s dramatic debate on anti-Semitism. As MP after MP described in harrowing detail their treatment at the hands of the thuggish army of Corbynite red-shirts, Corbyn rose and walked out, literally turning his back on those recounting their contemporary experience of an ancient hatred.\n\nFrom my position in the parliamentary press gallery, I looked down at the Labour front bench. It contained some of Corbyn\u2019s longest-standing supporters. They looked shell-shocked by what they were hearing. And, to their credit, utterly ashamed. Even his most battle-hardened parliamentary foot soldiers have become wearied by the dark-circus that surrounds The Absolute Boy.\n\nIf there is one thing harder than confronting Corbynite cultism, it is participating in it. And a number of key lieutenants are simply exhausted at having to defend wave after wave of anti-Semitism, Putin apologism, and Brexit opportunism.\n\nThen there is the fact that since the Election, political horizons within the Corbyn camp have altered dramatically. A year ago the pinnacle of their ambition was to embed change within the Labour Party. Now they believe \u2013 rightly \u2013 that they have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually enter government and impose radical change upon the nation itself. And when they look at Corbyn, they increasingly see someone encumbered with too much political baggage to carry them over the line.\n\nThere is also the human factor. Deities cast a long shadow. On Tuesday, the much maligned Diane Abbott gave one of the best speeches of her frontbench career. In a statement on Windrush, she produced a composed, forensic and highly personal evisceration of the Government\u2019s shameful disenfranchisement of an entire generation of black Britons. But all that was remembered was her insensitive and blinkered attempt to defend her leader in winding up the anti-Semitism debate.\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey is being eyed up as a potential replacement\n\nThe reality is Corbyn is sucking up too much political oxygen, and his colleagues are now recognising it. Over the past few weeks John McDonnell has begun to subtly \u2013 though not too subtly \u2013 construct a cordon sanitaire around his leader. He has adopted a clearly distinct line on issues as diverse as the Skripal poisoning, Brexit, Assad\u2019s responsibility for Douma and engagement with the City.\n\nHe has also begun to expand the range of his \u2018Corbynsplaining\u2019 \u2013 the technique by which he recasts Corbyn\u2019s views in his own words, always carefully prefixed with \u2018what Jeremy is saying is\u2026\u2019 But thinking the unthinkable is not the same as doing the unthinkable. And ironically, it\u2019s here that the Corbynites run into precisely the same problems as their moderate colleagues.\n\nOne is that, as yet, they do not have a ready alternative. McDonnell is the obvious candidate, but there are questions over his health, as well as whether party activists will stomach yet another male, pale and stale leader.\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey has been road-tested for the role but is not yet seen as ready. Angela Rayner was another hope but has since broken from the Corbynites, and is now regarded as a hostile. Clive Lewis\u2019s name has been mentioned, but he broke with Corbyn over Europe, though has since made efforts to crawl back into the fold.\n\nA further option is Emily Thornberry, despite questions remaining about the extent of her devotion to the Corbynite project. Another issue confronting the Corbynism-Without-Corbynites is how to make a change without shattering the faith of the true believers. Along with everyone else in politics, they are unclear in their own minds about how much of Labour\u2019s support rests on a genuine desire for radical change, and how much is the product of a deranged personality sect.\n\nThe consensus appears to be that if a decision was made to opt for a change, it could be sold to Labour members so long as it enjoyed the support of the influential pro-Corbyn activist group Momentum. Which is why recent signs of tension between Momentum leaders and Corbyn\u2019s office are significant.\n\nA further option is Emily Thornberry, despite questions remaining about the extent of her devotion to the Corbynite project\n\nAs are issues of timing. Just as Labour moderates hopes were dashed by Corbyn\u2019s dramatic over-performance at the General Election, so his former allies are carefully eyeing the local elections. They recognise that major Labour gains will probably recast the political narrative and remove any prospect of a change at the top in the short to medium term.\n\nSo for now, these heretical musings may very well remain just that. But the alt-Left advance is no longer simply wearing away its opponents. The football-terrace chants of support are beginning to stick in the throat. And even some of St Jeremy\u2019s staunchest allies are finally recognising the indefensible cannot be defended indefinitely. Life without Corbyn is no longer unthinkable, not even to the Corbynites."}, {"link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/two-men-knifed-outside-busy-12406364", "title": "Two men stabbed outside London tube station in broad daylight", "text": "Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

She sent them over with the scent on them.\n\n\u2018We put them in the traps, but a dog behaviourist said to also tie them in high places so the scent went further. By this time, Harvey\u2019s Army had fundraised for six extra cameras.\n\n'Every time there was a sighting we went out and set them up. It took hours. We did it constantly for months.\u2019\n\nIn December, the family even rehomed Goldie, Drogo\u2019s sister, hoping that would lure their pet back.\n\nThey know that Drogo has settled in the south of the island but now face a race against time \u2013 before lambing season begins in earnest."}, {"link": "http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/21/james-cameron-avatar-godfather/", "title": "James Cameron compares <em>Avatar</em> sequels to <em>The</em>\u00a0<em>Godfather</em>", "text": "James Cameron told journalists Saturday that his four planned Avatar sequels are at heart a \u201cgenerational family saga\u201d and compared the films to The Godfather.

But he was living a double life, and the world was about to find out.\n\nBelow is an extract from the new book Tiger Woods, published by Simon and Schuster.\n\n****\n\nACTING on a tip, the National Enquirer was hot on Tiger\u2019s trail once again. Back in 2007, it had seemed like a coup when IMG and sophisticated lawyers managed to squelch the Enquirer story about Woods and the pancake-house waitress in Orlando. But after that great escape, Tiger overlooked the fact that tabloids are like sharks that can detect prey from the scent of a single drop of blood in the water. Once Woods was wounded in \u201907, the Enquirer never stopped tracking him \u2014 and after Uchitel entered the picture, the chase was on. The tabloid staked out her apartment and waited to see what would happen.\n\n\u201cIt just became, well, let\u2019s follow her,\u201d said a source at the Enquirer.\n\n\u201cFollowing people looks good on TV, but in real life the success rate is, like, two per cent. Amazingly, this actually worked out all the way right up to the room.\u201d\n\nThe room in question turned out to be a suite on a special floor at the Crown Towers in Melbourne, Australia, where Woods was staying during the Australian Masters. Uchitel was headed there after receiving this email from Bryon Bell: \u201cHere are the details for all the flights. Sorry for all the changes. I look forward to meeting you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBell was a critical cog in the setting up and maintaining of the secrecy of Tiger\u2019s trysts. But this time a surveillance team photographed Uchitel\u2019s arrival at the Melbourne airport and hotel. Then, as she entered an elevator on her way to the thirty-fifth floor, an Enquirer reporter slipped inside and confronted her as she walked to Woods\u2019s suite. At first Uchitel denied any connection to Woods, but the futility of that approach quickly became apparent. She eventually returned to the US, leaving Team Tiger to sort out how to handle its most explosive scandal to date.\n\nWhile performing a staggering juggling act in his private life, Tiger won the Australian Masters by two strokes and pocketed a $3 million appearance fee. Afterward, he talked at length with Australian golf writers about the nuances of shot-making. \u201cI felt this was a tricky golf course in a sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not overly long, but you can hit marginal shots and have them in pretty bad spots. You had to make sure that you understood where to miss the golf ball. That\u2019s one of the things that I love on a golf course \u2014 it gets fast like this, and you have to manoeuvre the golf ball correctly.\u201d\n\nWoods\u2019s press conference was an insightful illustration of the compartmentalisation performed by a man living a double life. At a time when he was careening toward a steep cliff that threatened to expose his duplicity and ravage his marriage, he calmly talked about the thrill he derived from shaping a shot away from danger zones. Immune for so long to the responsibilities of everyday life, Woods had, no doubt, developed a gaping blind spot that covered the consequences of his narcissistic ways, enabling him to believe he could cheat on his wife with impunity and forever escape detection.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s also possible that the high-stakes risks he was taking with so many women \u2014 arranging clandestine trysts and lying about his singular devotion to each woman on his overgrown list of paramours \u2014 may have breathed oxygen into his creative genius as a golfer.\n\nPerhaps Woods had scaled Everest so many times as an athlete that he was forever searching for external sources of adrenaline rushes \u2014 deepwater diving, Navy SEAL training, extreme workouts. The women in his life, in that respect, were just another way to fill a void and satisfy an urge. As strange as it may sound, Tiger played some of his best golf in the years when his life was most out of control. It was as if the chaos in his life outside the ropes propelled his play on the course to new heights.\n\nBut on the flight home from Melbourne, a feeling of foreboding set in.\n\nBack in Isleworth, he confided to a fellow pro: \u201cI think I\u2019m about to come out on the wrong side of a big media story.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters was the fact that despite her attempts at discretion when confronted by the reporter in Australia, Uchitel had previously disclosed details of her affair with Woods to other people, one of whom had passed a polygraph and sold her story to the Enquirer.\n\nWoods tried to get the story killed. \u201cWe probably heard from every lawyer Tiger\u2019s ever employed in his life,\u201d said a source at the Enquirer.\n\nThis time, however, there would be no deal to save him from exposure.\n\nWith his gold-plated, family-friendly reputation facilitated by the likes of Nike and Disney and American Express, Woods was too alluring a target.\n\nFor the better part of four years, he\u2019d managed to elude the Enquirer. But now the superhero-like athlete with the magnetic smile that appeared on everything from Wheaties boxes to airport billboards was finally locked in the tabloid\u2019s crosshairs.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go in until you have the smoking gun, and then it really doesn\u2019t matter what they say,\u201d a source at the Enquirer said. \u201cThen it\u2019s like, \u2018Go ahead and sue me.\u2019 And we\u2019ll sue you for malicious prosecution.\u201d\n\nWhen it became apparent that even the combined forces of IMG and a platoon of high-priced lawyers were not going to be able to derail the story, Woods and his team started circling the wagons. Mark Steinberg telephoned Hank Haney, who was on his way to China to establish a junior golf academy. \u201cHank, I want to give you a heads-up,\u201d Steinberg told him. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a story coming out about Tiger and this girl. It\u2019s not true. Everything is going to be fine. But if anybody asks you about it, don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nSteinberg also sent a text to Steve Williams: \u201cThere is a story coming out tomorrow. Absolutely no truth to it. Don\u2019t speak to anybody.\u201d\n\nIt fell to Woods to convince his wife. He told her the tabloid story was a lie, that there was no affair between him and Uchitel. But on Monday, November 23, in advance of publication, the Uchitel expos\u00e9 began circulating on the internet. It contained a quote attributed to her that read like a dagger directed at Elin: \u201cIt\u2019s Tiger Woods. I don\u2019t care about his wife!\n\nWe\u2019re in love.\u201d\n\nBlindsided, Elin didn\u2019t know what to believe. It was the week of thanksgiving, and little Charlie had just learned to walk and was starting to say his first words. For Elin, these were monumental milestones of joy. But the suspicions in her mind were making it impossible to focus on anything else. In need of someone to confide in, she called the one person she trusted above all \u2014 her identical twin, Josefin. They had been best friends since childhood. Elin knew Josefin would know what to do.\n\nAfter obtaining a Master of Laws from the London School of Economics and Political Science, Josefin received her law degree in Sweden and joined the American-based firm McGuireWoods LLP. When Elin called her, Josefin was working out of the firm\u2019s London office, where she specialised in mergers and acquisitions. She immediately came to her sister\u2019s aid, providing emotional support and advice.\n\nWith the situation worsening, Woods took the extraordinary step of arranging a phone call between Elin and Uchitel, who corroborated Tiger\u2019s account that there had been no sexual relationship between them.\n\nUnconvinced, Elin wanted to see Tiger\u2019s phone. Afraid that she would find out about the other women in his life, Tiger frantically tried to cover his tracks. He left an urgent voicemail with Jaimee Grubbs: \u201cCan you please take your name off your phone? My wife went through my phone and may be calling you. So if you can, please take your name off ... [and] just have it as a number on the voicemail. You\u2019ve got to do this for me. Huge.\n\nQuickly. All right. Bye.\u201d\n\nThe following day, the Enquirer landed on supermarket racks in the Orlando area. It was the day before thanksgiving, and the \u201cWorld Exclusive\u201d headline \u201cTiger Woods Cheating Scandal\u201d splashed across the cover intensified the already dire atmosphere in the Woods home. The tension was amplified by the fact that Tiger\u2019s mother was visiting for the holiday.\n\nNothing triggered anxiety in Woods like the fear of disappointing his mother, and nothing had ever disappointed Kultida more than family betrayal \u2014 first when her parents abandoned her, and then when her husband was repeatedly unfaithful. It was overwhelming to contemplate how she would react to the realisation that her son had far eclipsed his father in the infidelity department.\n\nThe holiday provided a false appearance of reprieve. The Enquirer story got very little play elsewhere. But Tiger\u2019s cell phone was an explosive electronic record of his illicit affairs. His device had also become another addiction. On Thanksgiving Day, Woods couldn\u2019t resist texting multiple women, including Grubbs. In a short exchange, he wished Grubbs a happy thanksgiving, and she replied, \u201cu too love.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Elin remained fixated on Tiger\u2019s phone. After he fell into an Ambien-induced sleep on thanksgiving night, she searched his text history. She found one from him that said: \u201cYou are the only one I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d He had not sent that text to her.\n\nUnsure of the recipient\u2019s identity, Elin sent a text to the person from Tiger\u2019s phone. It read, \u201cI miss you. When are we seeing each other again?\u201d\n\nBefore long, a reply came back. While her husband slept, Elin called the mysterious number, and Uchitel picked up. Immediately recognising her voice, Elin lost it.\n\nIn the intense moments that followed, Woods awoke and emerged from his home barefoot in the middle of the night and got into his SUV.\n\nSpeeding out of his driveway, he lost control, clipping a hedge and swerving into his next-door neighbour\u2019s yard, driving over a fire hydrant and ploughing into a tree. When police arrived after responding to a 911 call from Tiger\u2019s neighbour, they found that the windows on both sides of the back seat of his vehicle had been smashed out with a golf club that had been swung by Elin.\n\nRenowned marriage therapist Esther Perel has worked with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. \u201cFew events in the life of a couple, except illness and death, carry such devastating force,\u201d Perel said.\n\nIn her best-selling book The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, Perel explains that the agony suffered by a betrayed spouse goes much deeper than just a violation of trust. \u201cIt\u2019s a shattering of the grand ambition of romantic love. It\u2019s a shock that makes us question our past, our future, and even our very identity. Indeed, the maelstrom of emotions unleashed in the wake of an affair can be so overwhelming that many psychologists turn to the field of trauma to explain the symptoms: obsessive rumination, hyper-vigilance, numbness and disassociation, inexplicable rages, uncontrolled panic.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Tiger Woods, it would be an understatement to say that Elin\u2019s discovery of his infidelity unleashed a maelstrom of emotions. As Woods lay unconscious on the road at 2:25am on November 27, 2009, blood on his teeth and lips, he finally appeared as he truly was \u2014 a vulnerable, fragile, deeply wounded person. In shock, Elin tended to the man who had broken her heart \u2014 placing a pillow under his head, slipping socks on his feet, covering him with a blanket, and pleading with him to open his eyes. Frantic, Kultida ran from the house, yelling, \u201cWhat happened?\n\nWhat happened?\u201d Soon police officers and paramedics were on the scene, asking the same question. As Tiger was placed on a gurney and rolled toward an ambulance, he momentarily opened his eyes and tried to speak. His lips moved, but there were no words. Then his eyes rolled back in his head, as if he were dead. Elin screamed and Kultida wept as the medics closed the doors and the ambulance lights slowly faded into the Florida night.\n\nExtracted from Tiger Woods by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian, published by Simon & Schuster, RRP $35."}, {"link": "http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/21/zoe-movie-amazon-tribeca-film-festival/", "title": "Amazon acquires Ewan McGregor, Christina Aguilera sci-fi film <em>Zoe</em>\u00a0out of Tribeca Film Festival", "text": "Ewan McGregor, L\u00e9a Seydoux, and Christina Aguilera will hit the big screen together later this year as their Tribeca Film Festival centerpiece selection Zoe has found a domestic distributor.\n\nDirector Drake Doremus confirmed Saturday that Amazon has purchased North American rights to the sci-fi romance, which is having its world-premiere at the New York City festival.

So yeah, three years,\u201d Cooper confirmed.\n\n\u201cI always realized that I was a bit different, I thought, then other people that were just acting, because I was so obsessed with the storytelling aspect of it, how you film it, how you tell a story, and that\u2019s what always interests me,\u201d he said of his transition to directing. \u201c[It] kept haunting me, that story \u2026 shots kept coming into my head, and I would dream about it, and I realized I just have to do it, I have to sort of purge it in a way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I knew that I had to do it. Whether it fails or not, I knew that I had to try. And I wound up absolutely loving it. \u2026 I don\u2019t wanna say too much because maybe you\u2019ll hate the movie, but I love it. I really love it. It\u2019s the movie I set out to make, which is hard to say,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have the benefit of editing, I\u2019ve been editing for a long time. Because the movie was gonna come out in May and now it\u2019s coming out in October, and that really was a benefit. I just hope I get to keep doing it.\u201d\n\nCooper praised the actors on the film, including Andrew Dice Clay, Sam Elliott, and Dave Chappelle, whom he said took two years to get him in the film. He called his titular Star, Lady Gaga, a revelation. \u201cShe said right from the beginning that this is gonna be a barter. \u2018I\u2019m gonna rely on you to get a performance that\u2019s honest out of me\u2019 \u2014 cause she\u2019s never done a film before \u2014 \u2018and I\u2019m gonna make sure that you turn into a musician. Because we\u2019re going to sing everything live,'\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Wait, wait, what?\u2019 And she said, \u2018No, the only way this is going to work \u2026 I can\u2019t stand when I watch musicals and you can tell that it\u2019s a prerecording, or lip syncing.\u2019 And she\u2019s right. So that was terrifying, but I really relied on her.\u201d\n\nAfter frequent collaborator David O. Russell joined De Niro and Cooper on stage, Cooper thanked both men for their support of his creative process. He recalled Russell viewing an early, nearly three-hour cut of the movie and giving him notes \u2014 from an airplane. \u201c[You] spent like 25 minutes just going through the whole thing right when you were in the middle of something. And it\u2019s that kind of camaraderie that I\u2019d always read about, with Scorsese and [De Niro], and the Coen brothers and their actors. To be able to be a person who has loved and admired these men so much, and then have them help me to create art has just been incredible.\u201d\n\nThe panel ended with a Q&A, where Cooper named Mike Nichols as another source of inspiration before he began filming A Star is Born. De Niro also fielded a question from the audience about which role he\u2019d never like to play \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d he replied without missing a beat.\n\nAfter a revolving door of Hollywood figures came and went in the process of rebooting the age-old industry tale (Beyonc\u00e9, Tom Cruise, and Jennifer Lopez reportedly circled a contemporary iteration at one point), Cooper officially signed on to A Star is Born in 2015, with Gaga joining the following year. The film comes as the fourth interpretation of the perennial drama about a washed-up performer cultivating the career of a young up-and-comer, which has played out on the big screen via Janet Gaynor and Frederic March in 1937, Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954, and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in 1976. The latter generously allowed Cooper to come ons stage at Glatsonbury in 2017, where Cooper sang in front of 80,000 people in order to film for the movie. \u201cHe let me take four minutes of his set, and then I got to say, \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, Kris Kristofferson,'\u201d he recalled at Tribeca.\n\n\u201cIt all comes down to this broken love story,\u201d Cooper previously told EW of the upcoming film\u2019s central romance between a fading crooner, Jackson Maine (Cooper), and the talented unknown, Ally (Lady Gaga, credited by her real name, Stefani Germanotta), he takes under his wing. \u201cI was also very interested in the character of Ally being a bit different than the other versions. She\u2019s not an ing\u00e9nue; she\u2019s not this innocent person,\u201d he adds about his interpretation of Gaga\u2019s character. \u201cYou\u2019ll be blown away by what [she\u2019s] created.\u201d\n\nNeal Preston/Warner Bros.\n\nFurther adding to the authenticity of the project is the curated roster of musicians who\u2019ve contributed original songs to the film\u2019s soundtrack, including Dave Cobb, Jason Isbell, Lukas Nelson, and Mark Ronson, who co-penned an emotional ballad titled \u201cThe Shallow\u201d with Gaga that Cooper hailed as one of the movie\u2019s standout pieces.\n\n\u201cAlly\u2019s rise has a musical arc to it. For Jackson\u2019s music, [Stefani] gave me the inspiration, she just said, \u2018Work, and then you\u2019ll figure out what kind of musician he is,\u2019 and that\u2019s really what happened,\u201d Cooper told EW in December 2017, further championing Gaga\u2019s insistence that he record the musical sequences live on set versus adding re-recorded vocals in post-production. \u201cI had the luxury of time. I spent two-and-a-half years prepping for this movie, and got to go see and work with so many people and had an incredible vocal coach, Roger Love, and great musicians to help me, and by the end he just kind of started developing into his own sort of creation. If I had another year of prep, it would have been complete rock, but now it\u2019s some sort of hybrid.\u201d\n\nA Star Is Born is slated to hit theaters at the top of awards season on Oct. 5.

The capital club duly won 3-0, but the real drama was taking place in Umbria.\n\nHaving started under clear blue skies, the Stadio Renato Curi was battered by rain, hailstones, thunder and lightning.\n\nReferee Pierluigi Collina was forced to delay the start of the second half by over an hour, with some claiming the match should have been abandoned.\n\nIn Rome they waited for news from Perugia, Lazio\u2019s match having finished by the time the second half kicked off.\n\nDefender Alessandro Calori struck four minutes after the extended break, Juventus lost 1-0, and Lazio took the title by a single point.\n\nJuventus 2001-02\n\nJuventus may have blown the title on the final day in 2000, but they were on the other end of the equation two years later.\n\nMarcello Lippi\u2019s return heralded three wins in a row to start the season, but the Bianconeri soon began to struggle, going six Serie A games without a win and dropping to sixth place.\n\nChampions Roma and an Inter side led by Hector Cuper took advantage, and by April a three-way title race had developed.\n\nWhen the Nerazzurri beat Roma in Week 28 as Juve lost 1-0 at Parma, it seemed certain they\u2019d win their first Scudetto since 1989.\n\nJuventus won four in a row before the final weekend of the season, but everything was very much in Inter\u2019s hands as they led by a point on the final day.\n\nCuper\u2019s side had only to beat Lazio in Rome, with many of the home fans actively cheering for the Beneamata, rather than see Roma or Juve take the title.\n\nGoals inside the first 10 minutes from David Trezeguet and Alessandro Del Piero quickly made it clear that Juventus would beat Udinese, and all eyes turned to Rome.\n\nChristian Vieri opened the scoring after 12 minutes, and though Karel Poborsky equalised, Lugi Di Biagio quickly put Inter back in front from a corner.\n\nHowever, Poborsky scored against just before half-time and the Nerazzurri collapsed in the second half, losing 4-2 as Ronaldo cried on the bench.\n\nJuventus won the Scudetto, and Antonio Cassano\u2019s delightful chip against Torino meant Inter finished the day in third-place.\n\nJuventus 2015-16\n\nIt may not have been the most dramatic Scudetto victory, but Juventus\u2019 triumph two seasons ago was certainly one of the greatest comebacks.\n\nWith 10 games played the Old Lady was 11 points off the top of Serie A, having won only one of their opening six games, before losing at Sassuolo in late October.\n\nA Derby della Mole against Torino on Halloween proved to be the turning point though, with Juan Cuadrado\u2019s 93rd-minute winner kicking off an extraordinary run of results.\n\nThe Bianconeri won 24 of 25 matches to win a record-equalling fifth Scudetto in a row, beating a Gonzalo Higuain inspired Napoli by nine points.\n\nSimone Zaza\u2019s 88th minute winner against the Partenopei on February 13 proved to be the crucial moment, with Roma\u2019s win over Napoli on April 25 mathematically handing Juve the title.\n\nSee the latest Serie A predictions and betting tips with Eurotips.co.uk"}, {"link": "http://www.football-italia.net/node/120282", "title": "Sarri has two Napoli doubts", "text": "Sarri has two Napoli doubts\n\nBy Football Italia staff\n\nMaurizio Sarri is tempted by two possible changes for the Scudetto showdown with Juventus, as Arkadiusz Milik and Piotr Zielinski are on fine form.\n\nIt kicks off in Turin at 19.45 UK time (18.45 GMT), click here for a match preview.\n\nNapoli\u2019s starting XI is now so classic that any fan can recite it without fear of error and the only absentee is long-term injury case Faouzi Ghoulam.\n\nKalidou Koulibaly returns from suspension, having missed the 4-2 win over Udinese on Wednesday, with Mario Rui and Elseid Hysaj as full-backs.\n\nYet there are two potential changes on Sarri\u2019s mind in midfield and attack.\n\nIt\u2019s rumoured Piotr Zielinski could get the nod rather than captain Marek Hamsik, which would be an unusual step, but not a new one by any means.\n\nZielinski started midweek against Udinese, but Allan and Jorginho should return after they were rested.\n\nThe other doubt is in attack, where Arkadiusz Milik is champing at the bit for his chance to battle it out with the tall Juventus centre-backs.\n\nThe Poland international tore his anterior cruciate ligament twice in under a year and only made his comeback last month, but in the last three games has contributed two goals and an assist.\n\nMertens is the number one choice for the attack and came so close to the Capocannoniere crown last season, but the Belgian is running out of steam.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t found the net since a 4-2 defeat to Roma on March 3, firing blanks for six consecutive rounds.\n\nHistory also doesn\u2019t smile on \u2018Ciro\u2019 Mertens, who has scored only two goals past Juventus.

Will there be a Booze Babysitter in a fleece in the Antipodean wine aisle, next to a diseased liver in a jar? A critic by the DVDs? \u2018Hmm. How To Be Single, not funny at all.\u2019 Will there be a Relationship Counsellor in the baby aisle who will shrug shoulders at the Lycra-clad male lump in shorts alongside you who\u2019d rather be home watching Arsenal? \u2018Hmm\u2026 I\u2019d get out while you can.\u2019\n\nWouldn't it be easier if customers could only access a supermarket if they can fit through a Keira Knightley-size template by the door or can drive a Chelsea tractor\n\nSupermarkets wish to check shopper's trolleys to see the food they are buying\n\nRather than Nutrition Nannies, wouldn\u2019t it be simpler to ban trolleys, and allow only one basket per person? Or since this is Waitrose, how about letting customers gain entry only if they fit inside a Keira Knightley-size template by the door, or can prove that they drive a Chelsea tractor?\n\nAnd if we are going to talk about making good choices, will they let me stand in the chilled aisle in a T-shirt proclaiming \u2018Meat is murder\u2019 and \u2018Dairy is scary\u2019?\n\nNo, thought not. This is a big brand trying to seduce you into thinking they care, when it is supermarkets \u2013 the heinous assault course that is the weekly shop, the over-packaging, the misleading \u2018farm\u2019 labels, the two-for-ones and the perfect veg \u2013 that have made us and the planet unhealthy in the first place.\n\nAnd to be honest, if you are lucky enough to shop in Waitrose, then you\u2019re probably affluent enough to mainline Innocent wheatgrass and lemon smoothies without the help of Mary Poppins.\n\nIf you can only afford to shop in Lidl, you\u2019re more likely to ponder whether to spend your last \u00a34 on a family-pack of nuggets and a bottle of fizzy water (17p for two litres! Amazing!) or blow the lot on chunky KitKats. And I don\u2019t blame them one bit.\n\nApparently, all the trendy people in East London are now buying pulses: split yellow peas, red lentils and black-eyed beans. That\u2019s what used to be called peasant food. But eating healthily \u2013 ie, like a Mediterranean peasant \u2013 has become a luxury. Most people don\u2019t have time to cook from scratch: Jamie\u2019s 30-minute meals never factored in parking, queuing and arguing. Now that women are no longer housewives, the supermarket sweep is done at the speed of Concorde.\n\nIf someone in a fleece tried to stop me to peer, point and judge, I\u2019d probably stab them. What if they spot the hair dye? Will they tell me it\u2019s time to stop stemming the tide and go all Mary Beard? It is so very easy to judge. Peep inside my basket from Selfridges Food Hall a few years ago, and you\u2019d have found kale, avocados, artisan bread and extra virgin rapeseed oil. I used to buy kumquats to float in every glass of organic flat rain water. I once bought a pineapple in Planet Organic for \u00a39. I\u2019d make my own low-sugar granola with coconut oil and agave nectar. Now that I\u2019m on a tight budget, I never buy fruit: it\u2019s too expensive!\n\nAnd why are the free apples and bananas near the checkout supposed to be only for children? What about those of us with scurvy?\n\nSo save us from the supermarket snoopers. No one wants to make bad choices. No one wants to burst out of that bikini, no matter how many plus-size women appear on Good Morning Britain in their undies prior to running the London Marathon to prove they might be fat but they\u2019re fit.\n\nOther factors are at play: genetics, depression, loneliness. I concede a bit of expert advice when shopping when you\u2019re anaemic, diabetic, have a fussy infant or can\u2019t find the tofu is helpful. But most of us know right from wrong.

It says Mrs Thatcher initially blocked a Government campaign warning people of the dangers of AIDS.\n\nShe was worried about 'alerting children to the existence of certain practices' \u2013 and said the adverts should be posted in 'public toilets, not broadcast on television'.\n\nShe also suggested they were against the Obscene Publications Act.\n\nMs Slocock says Mrs Thatcher's 'sensitivity about discussing sex' emerged when she put into her prime ministerial Red Box a Health Department briefing on a national survey into sexual practices.\n\nHer indignant note: In this extract, she writes: 'I think people rightly would be deeply offended by questions of this kind and I do not think we are entitled to intrude into their privacy. Neither Government, nor Government money should be involved in any way - if this survey goes ahead.'\n\nThe aim was to calculate how many people were at risk from AIDS and how to minimise the risk. Ms Slocock writes: 'She scrawled over my measured minute, 'All this just to reduce (possibly) a margin of error. I am absolutely against this. I think people rightly would be deeply offended by questions of this kind.' '\n\nMs Slocock says that despite Mrs Thatcher's protests, the research went ahead but without Government backing. According to the author, Mrs Thatcher saw 'any positive mention of gay sex in schools as subversive, potentially corrupting young minds away from family life'.\n\nMs Slocock says many people have never forgiven Mrs Thatcher for her 'infamous Section 28 law' that prohibited the promotion of homosexuality in schools.\n\nDefiant: Mrs Thatcher initially opposed the Government's campaign about AIDS\n\nBut she adds Mrs Thatcher's 'strong interest in gay sex' was demonstrated by her response to another document put in her Red Box, an explicit 30-page Whitehall document on sexual practices.\n\nAn aide wanted her to ban it on the grounds that it was 'bordering on pornographic'.\n\nThe book continues: 'It was a view Mrs Thatcher heartily endorsed. It went into exhaustive, explicit and colourful detail about every imaginable form of sexual practice that might be 'safe'.\n\n...But she was never afraid to use her 'fine ankles' to get her way Mrs Thatcher \u2018glowed with sex appeal\u2019 and used it to wield power over male politicians, according to Ms Slocock\u2019s book. She would wear \u2018sheer black tights\u2019 and sit in a way she knew showed off her \u2018fine ankles and pins\u2019 because it helped her win arguments with men. And she did it far more subtly than Theresa May, says Ms Slocock. \u2018Mrs Thatcher did not resort to low-cut outfits \u2013 unlike Theresa May on one of her first trips to try to negotiate Brexit with EU ministers, an unfortunate look, I thought.\u2019 However, Mrs Thatcher had no qualms about \u2018using her femininity in the exercise of her power\u2019. Ms Slocock recalls: \u2018I could see when I sat taking notes with her in the No 10 study at \u201cone-to-ones\u201d with Ministers or other men. It was obvious to me, as it would be to any other woman, that she knew she had good legs and fine ankles, even in her 60s. \u2018She arranged them so that others could always admire them, wearing black sheer tights and shaving her legs.\u2019 Ms Slocock says the effect Mrs Thatcher had on entering a room packed full of men was \u2018electric, energising and exciting\u2019. She \u2018was after power, not sex\u2026 but the hormonal effects are similar: you glow\u2019 \u2013 and \u2018liked tall men who looked as at home in a military uniform as a business suit\u2019. A young journalist called her \u2018distinctly sexy, with a naughty flush about her cheeks\u2019. The writer\u2019s name was Boris Johnson.\n\n'If you followed the advice, 'You could have safe sex with hundreds of strangers and never catch anything'.' It came back with more outraged scrawlings \u2013 but for all her indignation, it was obvious she had read it from beginning to end.\n\n'The underlinings sometimes veered off the horizontal, as they did when it was late at night and her pen was dropping as she was nodding off. But she kept going. She wanted to know everything, and nothing was going to stop her.'\n\nHowever, Ms Slocock denies Mrs Thatcher was anti-gay, pointing out she was one of the Tory MPs to vote for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1967.\n\nMs Slocock says she saw at first hand Mrs Thatcher's 'kindness, empathy and sympathy' towards two men dying from AIDS when she made a private visit to London's Mildmay Hospital \u2013 the same hospital visited by Princess Diana.\n\n'My diary recalls how sweet and tender she was toward them. It made a great impression on me. I'd seen the woman, not the politician, and the woman had an open heart.'"}, {"link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/21/barbara-bush-granddaughters-read-bible-passages-funeral/539106002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable", "title": "Barbara Bush's granddaughters gave emotional, moving readings during funeral service", "text": "CLOSE Former first lady Barbara Bush's granddaughters offered moving readings of scripture passages from Ecclesiastes, Proverbs and Corinthians at her funeral.

For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling\u2014 if indeed, when we have taken it off we will 5\n\nnot be found naked. For while we are still in this tent, we groan under our burden, because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. So we are always confident; even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord\u2014 for we walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we do have confidence, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

Thankfully there are attorneys that specialize in ensuring that you receive what you are entitled to whatever the intricacies of your case.\n\nMesothelioma\n\nMesothelioma is an aggressive form of cancer that develops in the lining of the lungs, abdomen, or heart and is typically caused by exposure to asbestos. According to a 2017 report by the Centers for Disease Control, 2,400 \u2013 2,800 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma in the United States each year. Those affected can also include family members who are exposed to the fibers that are carried home on the clothes of those who have been exposed first hand.\n\nFortunately, there are a number of avenues available to explore for those seeking compensation, and a skilled mesothelioma attorney can guide you through them. Included amongst the factors to be considered with your attorney might be;\n\nHave any previous claims been made?\n\nCompanies that have already paid out on a settlement have no obligation to do so more than once - but it\u2019s possible that family members can bring actions against related firms that have not settled.\n\nRelation to victim\n\nTypically, only a spouse, immediate family member, or a dependent of a person who passed away from mesothelioma is able to file for compensation although this varies state to state.\n\nStatute of limitations\n\nMesothelioma wrongful death cases need to be filed by 1-3 years after a patient\u2019s death. This again is variable depending on region.\n\nWith respect to the above, even if you fall foul of one or more of the criteria, it is still worth talking to an experienced and successful mesothelioma attorney as they might be able to find an issue that is specific to your case that could make a claim possible.\n\nPersonal Injury\n\nPersonal Injury is a legal area that covers everything from medical malpractice, work-related accidents, defective products, boating accidents, dog bites and even handling explosives. This is an area of litigation where the quality and experience of your representation can have a particularly major influence on the outcome of any compensation you are awarded.\n\nNegligence is a significant factor in many cases, meaning the plaintiff must prove that the defendant failed to provide legal duty of care. A good personal injury attorney has to be able to plead a case to the plaintiff\u2019s satisfaction and the jury\u2019s comprehension, not an easy task and often made even harder if the defendant is a large corporate organization with the means and inclination to bury or even ignore the claim.\n\nIn very severe cases involving permanent loss of limb use, or wrongful death, it is very important to ensure that you have the best possible representation with the expertise to support and guide you through the harrowing and treacherous legal minefield. Financially motivated defendants can take advantage of an occasion that is often intimidating and disorientating for a plaintiff, and a top attorney will help to prevent you being taken advantage of.\n\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation\n\nWorkers' compensation insurance provides financial benefits and/or medical care for workers who are injured or become ill as a direct result of their job. Employers are obligated to pay the premiums to cover each member of staff they employ.\n\nAn attorney that specializes in workers\u2019 compensation can advocate on your behalf if the employer or insurance carrier disputes your claim - as no cash benefits will be paid until the workers' compensation law judge decides which party is right. If you are not receiving benefits because the employer or insurance carrier is arguing that the injury is not job-related, you may be eligible for disability benefits in the meantime - your attorney can guide you in this. If you can return to work but your injury prevents you from earning the same wages you once did, you may be entitled to a benefit that will make up two-thirds of the difference.\n\nBusiness Law\n\nAttorneys specializing in this field represent you if you are in a business dispute and the matter can\u2019t be resolved through the normal negotiation or arbitration channels. Areas where business litigation attorneys are routinely called upon to advocate in disputes can include:\n\nFinances and Investments - has a broker acted in a client\u2019s best interest?\n\nIntellectual Property Ownership\n\nBreach of Fiduciary Duty - for example a case where a partner is alleged to have not acted in good faith and with the company interest in mind, meaning the other partners can try to mitigate against any losses for themselves and the business.\n\nInsurance Disputes - if commercial insurance companies undervalue or deny a fair claim, then businesses, (particularly small ones), can recover the amount they are entitled to using business litigation.\n\nInsurance law\n\nInsurance Law practice has three areas of focus: insurance coverage, insurance defense litigation, and insurance compliance. A typical situation could see you seeking to recover expenses related to an incident and the insurance provider questioning whether your policy is liable to cover your claim.\n\nInsurance coverage cases tend to focus on the language of the policy and take into account historical precedent for claims in a particular area. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, for example, it has become increasingly commonplace for flood exclusions and related provisions in homeowners and commercial policies to be challenged vigorously in the courts. This is an ever evolving sector of law and it is important that your attorney have a good track record and be fully up to speed with recent legislative outcomes in your claim area.\n\nEmployment Law\n\nIf you or a loved one is involved in an employment law dispute, it's in your best interest to consult with an employment law attorney immediately. Since employment law is such a broad area, lawyers typically specialize in one or a few aspects of practice. It's therefore important for you to seek out an attorney who is experienced in the relevant area of the law that affects you.\n\nFor example, if you feel that you've been the victim of workplace discrimination, you should seek out an attorney who has a proven track record in handling the type of discrimination claim you aiming to bring. On the other hand, if you're looking to appeal a workers' compensation decision, you should find an attorney who is well versed in the complex administrative procedures involved in workers' compensation law. A good attorney will use a steady hand to navigate your case through the myriad of legal maneuvers that can be deployed against you by the defendants in cases of this type.\n\nFor more information on Legal Insight Sections please contact inquiries@insight-team.com"}, {"link": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5643053/Shock-figures-half-graduates-worst-universities-arent-repaying-loans.html", "title": "Almost half of graduates from worst universities aren't repaying loans", "text": "Most students enter university in the hope that their degree will land them a better-paid job.

Yet there has been barely a ripple of dissent about Meghan Markle\u2019s engagement to Prince Harry.\n\nBut the political heat and fury of the Windrush row should serve as a warning to Conservatives \u2013 and to the other parties, which in truth have a much poorer record on race. If we are ever to be regarded as truly inclusive we must embrace, and be seen to embrace, people regardless of creed, colour or social class.\n\nThe Tories already have much to be proud of. We are on our second woman Prime Minister, we have a hatful of black and Asian MPs and peers, but we still have a lot of work to do if we are to convince people from council estates and comprehensive schools \u2013 just like myself \u2013 that we have the answer.\n\nI joined the Conservatives because I believe that all of Britain\u2019s \u2018communities\u2019 want the same things: to own their own stuff, to progress in life, to be self-reliant and to have a stake in society both economically and politically. But to do this, we in politics have to be honest. We have to ask and seek answers to difficult questions.\n\nI don\u2019t believe for one moment that the Windrush children whose immigration status has been questioned were ever singled out as targets for deportation. Instead they were caught up by an imperfect policy that was never intended to affect them.\n\nThe debacle happened because the issue was never properly debated. I share Theresa May\u2019s view that immigration should be controlled, but because we had signed up to the EU\u2019s freedom of movement, Parliament has never decided how many should be allowed to settle here.\n\nShould immigration increase or decrease? If so, by how much and over what period? What are the benefits and problems? What measures can alleviate them? None of this has been discussed. And everyone is afraid to even mention race.\n\nThe Left has seized on a leaked letter from Home Secretary Amber Rudd promising Mrs May she would give immigration officials greater teeth to accelerate deportation. Yet neither woman is remotely racist. In fact, their battle against uncontrolled immigration is both principled and colour-blind. Illegal immigrants are being targeted because they have no legal right to live, work or claim benefits here, not because of their colour.\n\nBut Mrs May needs to have confidence to say the Conservative Party is truly inclusive, to encourage far more black and Asian candidates to stand in council and parliamentary elections and take part in all aspects of public life \u2013 as magistrates, say, or school governors.\n\nShe needs to say that Brexit will give us the opportunity to treat all immigrants as equal \u2013 and that Britain provides a golden opportunity to all those who want to work.\n\nIn short, she needs to be clear the immigrant dream of hard work and success is indivisible from Conservative philosophy.\n\nAnd a welcome start will be putting things right with the Windrush children who have done so much for Britain."}, {"link": "https://www.rte.ie/news/europe/2018/0422/956286-eu-and-mexico-reach-part-agreement-on-trade-deal/", "title": "EU and Mexico reach part agreement on trade deal", "text": "The EU and Mexico say they have reached an \"agreement in principle\" to modernise an existing free trade deal, as the Latin American country faces pressure from protectionist measures threatened by US President Donald Trump.\n\nUnder the updated terms of the 2000 deal, \"practically all bilateral trade in goods will now be duty-free, including in the agricultural sector,\" the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said in a statement.\n\nThe move is seen as sending a strong signal to President Trump who last year launched renegotiations of what he has previously referred to as Mexico's \"cash cow\" - the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nThe US leader's threat to even axe NAFTA altogether if he is not happy with the new conditions has stoked tensions and uncertainty among signatories to the deal, which also include Canada.\n\nA deal with the EU is part of Mexico's strategy to reduce its reliance on the United States, the destination of 80 per cent of its exports.\n\nThe EU-Mexico agreement was reached after \"months of intense negotiations, said a statement co-signed by EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, her agriculture counterpart Phil Hogan, and Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal.\n\nWhile some \"technical issues\" remained, Brussels said it expected to finalise the full legal text by the end of the year.\n\n\"In less than two years the EU and Mexico have delivered a deal fit for the economic and political challenges of the 21st century,\" said Malmstrom.\n\n\"Today's agreement also sends a strong message to other partners that it is possible to modernise existing trade relations when both partners share a clear belief in the merits of openness, and of free and fair trade.\"\n\nThe pact, which is modelled on a recently agreed trade deal between Brussels and Canada, will then need to be green-lighted by the bloc's 28 member states and the European Parliament.\n\nOn Wednesday, the EU unveiled plans to fast-track deals with Japan and Singapore, saying it was leading the defence of free trade in the face of US \"protectionism\"."}, {"link": "http://us.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/01/20/melania-trump-first-year-bennett-dnt-newday.cnn", "title": "A look back at Melania's first year  - CNN Video", "text": "Melania Trump is perhaps a unique first lady in modern history, an immigrant, a fashion model, a third wife, and by her own account, a notoriously private woman.

However, RS Secretariat sources said this violation alone cannot be sufficient reason for rejecting the impeachment notice.\n\nAfter handing over the notice for impeachment to Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition leaders had addressed a press conference on Friday. While they spoke on the charges they had levelled against the CJI, they did not, however, release a copy of the notice.\n\nA former secretary general of the Rajya Sabha is learnt to have pointed out to the RS Secretariat, which is examining the impeachment notice, that Rule 2.2(VIII) in the chapter on \u2018General Matters\u2019 of the \u2018Handbook for Members of Rajya Sabha, says: \u201cA notice for raising a matter in the House should not be given publicity by any member or other person until it has been admitted by the Chairman and circulated to members.

What convention are they talking about? Ask the BJP if this was practised when similar proceedings were carried out in the past. Even if such a provision exists, it will fall foul of Article 19(1)a of the Indian Constitution which guarantees freedom of expression. There are exceptions only for contempt of court, security of the state and defamation,\u201d an Opposition MP, who is among those who have signed the impeachment notice, told The Sunday Express.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, another former secretary general of the Rajya Sabha said the handbook is just a \u201cguideline\u201d listing good practices, and it is the \u2018Rules of Business\u2019 that are \u201cparamount\u201d. The former official said the RS Secretariat has to ascertain only two points: whether the notice has the signatures of 50 sitting members, and whether it is a substantive motion. \u201cA motion must lead to action. That wording is important. If it does not, it can be rejected. But there is no way the motion can be pre-judged. It is for the inquiry committee of judges to decide,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of this provision (barring publicity), but in any case the handbook is just a guideline. The Rules of Business of the RS are paramount. In the case of Lok Sabha, for example, the relevant provision about publicity to notices is a rule. For RS, it\u2019s just a handbook,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe notice is under examination. But violation of just this one rule cannot be sufficient ground for its rejection, if all other conditions are met. The Vice President is travelling, he will be back on April 23-24. A decision will be taken in keeping with all other rules and provisions,\u201d said a senior official in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat.\n\nBut government sources maintained that dismissal of the notice \u201cat some stage\u201d is inevitable. \u201cThe press conference shows what has already been alleged in many quarters, that the notice is politically motivated,\u201d said a senior official in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat.\n\nOn Friday, seven Opposition parties \u2014 Congress, CPI(M), CPI, NCP, SP, BSP and IUML \u2014 launched an unprecedented move to impeach CJI Dipak Misra, accusing him of corruption, misusing his authority and failing to protect the independence of the judiciary. The notice for impeachment was signed by 64 MPs and seven former MPs, who recently retired.\n\nIn their notice, the parties listed five \u201ccharges of misbehaviour\u201d against the CJI and argued that, as MPs, they are \u201centitled to hold the Chief Justice accountable\u201d and that \u201cthe majesty of the law is more important than the majesty of any office\u201d.\n\nIn the past, impeachment notices have had a high strike rate.

The poor conviction rate in cases of child rape goes to show that death penalty \u2013 which comes at the sentencing stage, post-convictions \u2014 will mean little to a vast majority of the victims.\n\nTwo telling sets of figures from the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) put a question mark on the effectiveness of death as a deterrence for child rape. In 2016, of the 64,138 child rape cases that came up before the courts under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act read with IPC Section 376, 1,869 cases \u2014 or less than three per cent \u2014 ended in convictions. Moreover, of the total cases of rape of women and children before the police that year, in over 94 per cent of the cases (34,650 out of 36,657 cases), the offender was known to the victim \u2014 he was either a close family member, a neighbour, or an acquaintance. Given this reality, experts point to the need for more debate before any amendment of the criminal law is carried out to award death penalty for cases of child rape, as sought by the proposed ordinance cleared by the Union Cabinet on Saturday.\n\nSays Supreme Court advocate Vrinda Grover, \u201cFar from reporting the crime, death penalty is going to deter the victim from reporting sexual assault when the offender is from the family or is known to them. This will lead to the crime being suppressed and the victim being left completely helpless. Without strengthening the investigation process or the prosecution, creating an enabling environment both in the court and outside, and improving the conviction rate, the sentence is irrelevant.\u201d\n\nALSO READ | Union Cabinet clears ordinance awarding death penalty for child rape\n\nDespite the POCSO Act providing for trials to be completed within a year, at the end of 2016, 89 per cent of the cases were pending trial. The poor conviction rate in cases of child rape goes to show that death penalty \u2013 which comes at the sentencing stage, post-convictions \u2014 will mean little to a vast majority of the victims.\n\nPointing to how the death sentence given to the convicts in the December 2012 gang rape case has not deterred such crimes, Grover termed the proposed Ordinance \u201ca populist gimmick by the government to blunt the criticism\u201d.\n\nIn addition to the proposed amendment to Section 42 of the POCSO Act and IPC Section 376 (rape laws) to allow for death penalty for rape of girls under 12, the Ordinance also seeks to amend CRPC Sections 173 and 309 to set a two-month time-frame within which police investigation in rape cases and trial will have to be completed. But the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, had already changed these two laws to state that in all cases of rape, \u201ctrial shall, as far as possible, be completed within a period of two months\u201d and that \u201c investigation in relation to rape of a child may be completed within three months\u201d.\n\nGrover explains such amendments are futile if investigations continue to be shoddy or if \u201cjudges are not trained to handle cases of child sexual assault and gender-based violence\u201d.\n\nThe Justice Verma committee, formed in the aftermath of the December 2012 Delhi gang rape case, had held in its report that \u201cdeath penalty would be a regressive step in the field of sentencing and reformation\u201d. The report cited the Working Group on Human Rights to state that the murder rate had declined consistently in India over the last 20 years despite the slowdown in execution of death sentences since 1980. The Justice Verma panel only recommended enhancing punishment for aggravated forms of rape to life term, stating there is \u201cconsiderable evidence that the deterrent effect of death penalty on serious crimes is actually a myth\u201d.\n\nALSO READ | Kathua, Unnao cases: Your assurances of justice for rape victims \u2018wholly inadequate, platitudinous\u2019, academics tell PM Modi\n\nHowever, in the wake of the outcry following the Delhi gang rape, the UPA government, in its Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, introduced death penalty for non-homicide offence of rape under IPC Sections 376E (for repeat offenders) and 376A (for rape that reduces the victim to persistent vegetative state).\n\nIn 2014, under this Section 376E of the IPC, three men were sentenced to death in the Shakti Mills gang rape case in Mumbai.\n\nPersis Sidhva, advocate with the Flavia Agnes-run Majlis Legal Centre, which while providing support to the Shakti mills rape survivors publicly took a stand against death penalty, says, \u201cDeath penalty shifts the burden on to the victim as, since the offenders are known to them in most cases, they are likely to turn hostile or not report the crime.\u201d\n\nShe adds that ordinary cases do not stand a chance for speedy trial when even in high-profile cases such as Shakti Mills and the Delhi gang rape case, the trial was not completed within two months because of the courts being overburdened.\n\n\u201cProposing fast-track courts do not help when the number of judges remain the same or if the prosecutors are not capable of handling such cases,\u201d says Sidhva.\n\nThe government has also proposed to extend its existing 180 one-stop centres for rape survivors to cover all districts in the country, but Sidhva points out that a district-level centre does little to improve access to justice. \u201cWhat is required is a state-run victim support programme at the taluka level so that the victim has access to justice at every stage, be it for following up with the police, in the hospital or the court,\u201d she says.\n\nIn its \u2018Death Penalty India Report 2016\u2019, the National Law University (Delhi) has cited how the US Supreme Court ruled that it would be unconstitutional to extend the death penalty to non-homicide offences like rape, including rape of a minor.\n\nThe NLU report interviewed 373 of the 385 prisoners in India on death row to conclude that the structural reality of death penalty in India shows that it is \u201cdisproportionately imposed on vulnerable persons along the axes of economic and social parameters\u201d. The study showed that 23% of prisoners sentenced to death had never attended school, 9.6% did not complete primary school education and 61.6% had not completed their secondary school education. Also, 76% of those sentenced to death in India belong to backward classes and religious minorities while 74% of the prisoners on death row are economically vulnerable.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"}, {"link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-no-deal-food-drink-industry-disastrous-wto-free-trade-eu-a8315566.html", "title": "No deal Brexit will be 'disastrous' for food and drinks industry, MPs warn", "text": "Failing to secure a free trade deal after Brexit will be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Britain\u2019s \u00a328bn processed food and drinks industry and must be avoided at all costs, a committee of MPs has warned.\n\nIn a new report they claimed that without access to European Union markets after the end of the transition period, in December 2020, exports of processed foods such as chocolate, cheese, beef, pork and soft drinks would suffer while UK consumers would face higher prices and less choice on the supermarket shelves.\n\nThe stark warning comes from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, with MPs also saying that reversion to World Trade Organisation rules after withdrawal from the bloc would have a \u201cseismic impact\u201d on the country\u2019s largest manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cThe sector would undeniably suffer from reverting to WTO tariffs in the event of a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario,\u201d the MPs\u2019 report states.\n\nThe committee added British participation in the single market and customs union had led to an \u201cover reliance\u201d on EU markets, which accounted for 60 per cent of the \u00a322bn in processed food and drinks exports in 2017.\n\nThey said during their inquiry the committee did not hear any evidence that moving away from the current customs arrangements could be beneficial to UK manufacturers or consumers.\n\nIt echoes a similar warning from Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe, who last month said the supermarket would have to increase prices if any barriers to imports were introduced after Brexit.\n\nRachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe success of the industry has been highly dependent on participating in the single market and customs union.\n\n\u201cTo ensure the continued success of our food and drinks industry, the government must provide clarity and certainty on our future relationship with the EU and seek continued regulatory, standards and trading alignment with the EU in the processed food and drink sector.\u201d\n\nThe report added that the industry, which employs 400,000 people \u2013 a third of them EU nationals \u2013 would \u201cundeniably suffer\u201d if Britain left without a trade deal and was forced to fall back on WTO rules.\n\nBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 show all Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/7 Customs union A key point in the negotiations remains Britain's access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does? No 10 has so far insisted that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d and that Britain will be leaving the customs union, but may be inclined to change its position once the potential risks to the UK\u2019s economic outlook become clearer. Alamy\n\n2/7 Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party\u2019s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a \u201cspecific solution\u201d would need to be found. Getty\n\n3/7 Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier (seen here with EU Minister David Davis) has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. Rex\n\n4/7 Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty\n\n5/7 Future trade agreement (with the EU) Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU. Infighting within the Cabinet has prevented a solid position from being reached, with some MPs content that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" while others rally behind single market access. The EU has already confirmed that access to the single market would be impossible without the UK remaining in the customs union. Getty Images\n\n6/7 Future trade agreements (internationally) The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London. However the UK cannot make trade agreements with another country while it is still a member of the EU, and the potential loss of trade with the world's major powers is a source of anxiety for the PM. The EU has said the UK cannot secure trade deals during the transition period. EPA\n\n7/7 Financial services Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal. However according to new reports Germany has suggested allowing trade on the condition that the UK continues paying into the EU budget even after the transition period. Getty\n\n\u201cThe EU\u2019s most favoured nation tariffs under WTO rules would be disastrous for UK exports and must be avoided at all cost,\u201d the committee said.\n\n\u201cA no deal scenario would be unviable and unacceptable to the sector as, at least in the short term, the EU is the UK\u2019s main trading partner. It would also have serious repercussions for importers of UK products in the EU and the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nThe committee warned that if the UK tried to lower or remove tariffs on imports after Brexit, the consequences for British farming could be \u201cextremely serious\u201d while the impact on prices in the shops was likely to be \u201cvery limited\u201d.\n\nIt said that Britain should remain \u201cas close as possible\u201d to EU regulations, warning that UK consumers \u201cwould not tolerate any lowering of standards\u201d. It also urged the government to seek a deal on immigration to allow the industry continued access to EU labour \u2013 both skilled and unskilled \u2013 on which it is heavily reliant."}, {"link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2018/04/21/no-6-seed-pelicans-nba-playoff-history-first-round-sweep-trail-blazers/539641002/", "title": "No. 6 seed Pelicans make NBA playoff history with first-round sweep of Trail Blazers", "text": "CLOSE Ben Simmons became the fifth rookie in NBA history with a playoff triple-double, Justise Winslow needed stitches above his eye, and the 76ers held on for a 106-102 win over the Heat in Game 4.

But fellow backcourt mate Damian Lillard, it\u2019s safe to say, will face all sorts of scrutiny for the way his season came to an end. In the four games, Lillard averaged 18.5 points (35.2% shooting overall, 30% from three-point range) to go with 4.8 assists, 4.5 rebounds and four turnovers.\n\nThe Pelicans, who lost DeMarcus Cousins to a season-ending Achilles tendon injury in late January, led 58-56 at halftime but pulled away with a 42-point third quarter that included Davis scoring 19 points.

They lost Game 3 and Game 5 in overtime.\n\nBut Tortorella said he's not concerned about his players bouncing back.\n\n\"I won't have to say a [darn] word to them,\" Tortorella said. \"We'll be back here for Game 7.\"\n\nCapitals captain Alex Ovechkin made a similar prediction after Washington lost 5-4 in overtime in Game 2, saying they would win Game 3 and Game 4 at Columbus and return home for Game 5 with the series tied 2-2, which the Capitals did.\n\nVideo: CBJ@WSH, Gm5: Tortorella on loss, eyes return to D.C.\n\nNow, it's the Blue Jackets' turn to back up Tortorella's words.\n\n\"Well, what else are you going to say?\" Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. \"That's good. He wants to get it out there (that) he believes in his team, just as I believe in my team. So it's our job for that not to happen, and we're going to try to do that.\"\n\nThe Blue Jackets might have played their best game of the series on Saturday, outshooting the Capitals 42-29, after a being outplayed in a 4-1 loss in Game 4 at Columbus on Thursday. They believe if they bring play similar in Game 6, they will fulfill Tortorella's prophecy.\n\n\"Our backs are against the wall, right?,\" Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno said. \"If you can't play your best game come Monday, then that's disappointing. I don't have any worries at all about our group going into Monday. If we have the same effort, the same mentality that we did tonight, we should be just fine.\""}, {"link": "http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/21/resogun-dev-housemarque-reveals-new-game-stormdivers", "title": "Resogun Dev Housemarque Reveals New Game Stormdivers - IGN", "text": "Share.

Others are prevented from getting up by their walking frames being put out of reach or by being sedated with drugs. The techniques are used, say the researchers, because of an exaggerated fear that patients will fall if left to move around wards freely. The study says the tactics lead to the \u201cdehumanisation\u201d of patients, leaving them angry and highly stressed and worsening their already poor health.\n\nThe findings, which have been shared with the Observer, have triggered a fresh row over how the NHS treats people with dementia, who occupy up to half the beds in some hospitals. Dr Eileen Burns, president of the British Geriatrics Society, which represents doctors, nurses and therapists who work with older people, said: \u201cThese findings are a huge concern. Sometimes the use of containment techniques is not justified.\u201d\n\nShops, cafes and round-the-clock care: life in a \u2018dementia village\u2019 Read more\n\nBurns added that too many ward staff perform \u201ca custodial role\u201d towards inpatients with dementia, though she said containment was sometimes needed to benefit the patient\u2019s own health, as when bandages were placed over drips so they cannot be removed.\n\nThe report says that while the organisation of wards in unsuitable for people with dementia, it is also unhelpful for staff - many of whom lack the skills and training to cope properly with such a needy group of patients.\n\n\n\nThe research was undertaken by Dr Katie Featherstone, a reader in the sociology of medicine at Cardiff University, and Dr Andy Northcott, a lecturer in allied health sciences at De Montfort University, Leicester. They studied in detail how dementia patients in 10 wards of five unnamed hospitals in England and Wales were treated over the course of 18 months. It was funded by the National Institute for Health Research, the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s research arm.\n\nThe researchers found that many dementia patients resist and reject the care provided to them in hospital because they are unhappy about their treatment.\n\nFeatherstone and Northcott conclude that the way staff deal with dementia patients, and the use of containment techniques, is \u201cfrequently the trigger of resistance or cause of patient anxiety\u201d, though staff sometimes wrongly blame that on the dementia itself.\n\nTheir findings echo previous reports detailing inadequate care received by dementia patients published by Sir Robert Francis and the Care Quality Commission amongst others.\n\nFeatherstone told the Observer: \u201cPeople with dementia on wards generally have early to mid-stage dementia. But part of the problem is that when they are admitted to an acute ward, staff see them as having late-stage dementia, so assume they can\u2019t eat, drink, stand, walk or go to the bathroom independently, even though they still can, and don\u2019t let them keep doing these things. Staff see them as being quite helpless, even though they aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWhen staff react like that, that breeds resentment and high levels of anxiety and resistance to care, for example patients refusing to take their medication, and triggers unhappiness. It\u2019s very isolating and scary for people with dementia to be in hospital. They are a difficult population to handle, and very needy, and I think there\u2019s a strong sense that staff resent them being there,\u201d she said.\n\nBurns said containment was sometimes needed to benefit the patient\u2019s own health, for example, putting a bandage over a drip so it cannot be removed. Lack of staff means nurses do not have the time to talk to patients about their lives or look at old photographs with them to give them mental stimulus, she added.\n\nQ&A What are the financial pressures on the NHS that have built up over the last decade? Show Hide Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, health spending increased by an average of 1.2% above inflation and increases are due to continue in real terms at a similar rate until the end of this parliament. This is far below the annual inflation-proof growth rate that the NHS enjoyed before 2010 of almost 4% stretching back to the 1950s. As budgets tighten, NHS organisations have been struggling to live within their means. In the financial year 2015-16, acute trusts recorded a deficit of \u00a32.6bn. This was reduced to \u00a3800m last year, though only after a \u00a31.8bn bung from the Department of Health, which shows the deficit remained the same year on year. Read a full Q&A on the NHS winter crisis\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment on the use of containment and restraint.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u201cWe expect everyone with dementia to be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. That\u2019s why we invested \u00a350m to make hospitals and care homes dementia-friendly.\n\n\u201cMore than 875,000 NHS staff have undertaken awareness-raising activities and we continue to support [NHS] trusts to sign up to the Dementia Action Alliance\u2019s dementia friendly hospital charter.\u201d"}, {"link": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-22/barbara-bush-remembered-as-family-enforcer/9684856", "title": "Barbara Bush remembered as family's 'enforcer'", "text": "Barbara Bush remembered as family's 'enforcer' at funeral attended by 1,500\n\nUpdated\n\nBarbara Bush has been remembered as the \"first lady of the greatest generation\" at her funeral, which was attended by four former US presidents and hundreds of other people who filled the church with laughter as much as tears, with many recalling her quick wit and devotion to family.\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush joked his mother \u2014 wife of the 41st US president and mother of the 43rd \u2014 called her style of mothering him and his siblings \"a benevolent dictatorship \u2014 but honestly, it wasn't always benevolent\".\n\nHe emphasised how she believed in the power of laughter and that joy should be shared.\n\nHe said he could still feel her presence inside the nation's largest Episcopal church and she would likely have given him advice on his eulogy: \"Jeb, keep it short.

The homeless man has been charged with murder in a random stabbing attack in which a man was killed while he was sitting down to dinner with his wife and child at a beachside steakhouse in Southern California restaurant. (Ventura County District Attorney's Office via AP)\n\nA homeless man who randomly stabbed a man to death as he was holding his daughter in a crowded Southern California restaurant was reported just a few hours earlier for disruptive behavior but police ultimately determined he was not a threat, authorities said Saturday.\n\nJamal Jackson, 49, is facing a first-degree murder charge in the death of 35-year-old Anthony Mele. He was being held in Ventura County jail on $1.5 million bail. It was unclear if Jackson, who is also a convicted felon, had an attorney to speak on his behalf.\n\nMele and his wife were eating dinner with their 5-year-old daughter Wednesday at Aloha Steakhouse in Ventura. The girl was sitting on her father's lap when prosecutors say Jackson walked up and stabbed Mele in the neck.\n\nProsecutor Richard Simon said patrons and a restaurant employee followed Jackson out of the restaurant, even though he still had the knife. They kept track of him until Ventura police arrived and arrested him.\n\nMele was taken to a hospital and died Thursday after being taken off life support.\n\n\"It's horrible,\" Simon said. \"You don't think you're going to be killed when you go out to dinner at a nice restaurant with your family and you didn't do anything.\"\n\nSimon said the two men had not interacted before the attack.\n\n\"He was just sitting there with his daughter in his lap,\" Simon said. \"You're not supposed to die that way.\"\n\nMele's loved ones started a GoFundMe page to help raise money for a funeral and to support his wife and daughter.\n\nMele's Facebook page was filled with photos of his daughter and said he was a manager at an AT&T store.\n\nPolice confirmed that a bystander reported a man \u2014 who turned out to be Jackson \u2014 for disruptive behavior several hours before the stabbing.\n\nAccording to the bystander, a man was yelling on the promenade not far from the beachside restaurant about three hours before the attack.\n\nPatrol officers were out on other calls so command center staff monitored the man via a pier security camera system for more than 20 minutes before deciding he didn't seem to be a threat, police said.\n\nPolice are asking anyone who spoke with Jackson during that time to contact investigators.\n\nThe killing prompted the Ventura City Council to increase police patrols in the area and add staff members to monitor security cameras, among other measures.\n\n\"We are extremely disheartened and infuriated by this criminal attack,\" Mayor Neal Andrews said in a statement. \"We will not tolerate this in our community. Nothing is more important than the safety of our visitors, residents and businesses.\"\n\nIf convicted, Jackson faces up to 55 years in prison. According to online court records, he has prior convictions for burglary and unlawful sexual intercourse dating back to the 1990s.\n\nIf you would like to donate to a GoFundMe account set up for the Mele family, you may do so here.

He was being held in Ventura County jail on a $1.5 million bail. It was unclear if Jackson, who is also a convicted felon, had an attorney to speak on his behalf.\n\nMele and his wife were eating dinner with their 5-year-old daughter Wednesday at Aloha Steakhouse in the seaside city of Ventura. The girl was sitting on her father's lap when prosecutors say Jackson walked up and stabbed Mele in the neck.\n\nProsecutor Richard Simon said customers and a restaurant employee followed Jackson out of the restaurant, even though he still had the knife. They kept track of him until Ventura police arrived and arrested him.\n\nMele was taken to a hospital and died Thursday after being taken off life support.\n\n\"It's horrible,\" Simon said. \"You don't think you're going to be killed when you go out to dinner at a nice restaurant with your family and you didn't do anything.\"\n\nSimon said the two men had not interacted before the attack.\n\n\"He was just sitting there with his daughter in his lap,\" Simon said. \"You're not supposed to die that way.\"\n\nMele's loved ones started a GoFundMe page to help raise money for a funeral and to support his wife and daughter.\n\nMele's Facebook page was filled with photos of his daughter and said he was a manager at an AT&T store.\n\nPolice confirmed that a bystander reported a man \u2014 who turned out to be Jackson \u2014 for disruptive behavior several hours before the stabbing.\n\nAccording to the bystander, a man was yelling on the promenade not far from the beachside restaurant about three hours before the attack.\n\nPatrol officers were out on other calls so command center staff monitored the man via a pier security camera system for more than 20 minutes before deciding he didn't seem to be a threat, police said.\n\nPolice are asking anyone who spoke with Jackson during that time to contact investigators in the city 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles.\n\nJackson also had half a dozen contacts with police in Ventura since the beginning of the year, including an arrest after a physical fight at a park, said Commander Tom Higgins.\n\nHe was also stopped on March 31 after a passer-by reported he was brandishing a knife. Police searched his bag and found a knife but there was no victim so no charge was filed, Higgins said.\n\nJackson has a lengthy rap sheet including charges in San Bernardino County, Higgins said, as well as convictions for burglary and unlawful sexual intercourse dating back to the 1990s.\n\nThe killing prompted the Ventura City Council to increase police patrols in the area and add staff members to monitor security cameras, among other measures.\n\n\"We are extremely disheartened and infuriated by this criminal attack,\" Mayor Neal Andrews said in a statement. \"We will not tolerate this in our community. Nothing is more important than the safety of our visitors, residents and businesses.\"\n\nIf convicted, Jackson faces up to 55 years in prison.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, contributed to this report."}, {"link": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-22/verne-troyer-mini-me-actor-austin-powers-dies-aged-49/9684860", "title": "Mini-Me actor Verne Troyer dies aged 49", "text": "Verne Troyer, Mini-Me actor from Austin Powers films, dies aged 49\n\nUpdated\n\nActor Verne Troyer, who was best known for playing Mini-Me in Austin Powers, has died aged 49, according to an official social media post.\n\nA statement provided by Troyer's representatives said the actor died on Saturday.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and incredibly heavy hearts to write that Verne passed away today,\" a post on his official Facebook page read.\n\nThe BBC reported that earlier this month, he was admitted to hospital in Los Angeles, although it was not immediately clear why.\n\nLast year, he was hospitalised for alcohol addiction.\n\n\"Verne was an extremely caring individual.

He has also asked the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, to report on the impact of technology on young people\u2019s mental health, and to recommend healthy limits for screen time.\n\nIn the letter, Hunt tells the companies that their work on devising ways to verify the age of children accessing social media platforms, on screen-time limits, and on measures to end cyberbullying has fallen short.\n\n\u201cIn particular, progress on age verification is not good enough ... I am concerned that your companies seem content with a situation where thousands of users breach your own terms and conditions on the minimum user age.\n\n\u201cI fear that you are collectively turning a blind eye to a whole generation of children being exposed to the harmful emotional side-effects of social media prematurely; this is both morally wrong and deeply unfair on parents, who are faced with the invidious choice of allowing children to use platforms they are too young to access, or excluding them from social interaction that often the majority of their peers are engaging in. It is unacceptable and irresponsible for you to put parents in this position.\u201d\n\nWith the NHS facing a mounting crisis over a lack of mental health services for young people, the Guardian reported last year that an increasing number of young women were suffering mental health problems linked to conflicts with friends, fears about their body image and pressures created by social media.\n\nRates of stress, anxiety and depression were rising particularly sharply among teenage girls. NHS data showed that the number of times a girl aged 17 or under has been admitted to hospital in England because of self-harm had jumped from 10,500 to more than 17,500 a year over the previous decade \u2013 a rise of 68%. The rise among boys was much lower at 26%.\n\nHunt recognises in the letter that some progress has been made in developing new products to help parents limit what their children can access, but says it is nowhere near enough to convince him that the voluntary process for addressing the issues is working.\n\nHe adds that the pioneering services offered by the companies are not matched by an accompanying willingness to protect young people from the adverse effects: \u201cYour industry boasts some of the brightest minds and biggest budgets globally.

The first thing he said in court when the trial began at the start of last month, after denying that he murdered Wall, appeared to reveal the \u201cnarcissistic traits\u201d forensic psychiatrists had identified.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing worse that can happen to a person like me,\u201d he said of the gruesome death and dismemberment of the talented 30-year-old journalist. \u201cThe moment Kim Wall died, there was nothing left for me to fight for.\u201d\n\nThe case has gripped Denmark and Sweden, with at least six newspapers and broadcasters live-blogging every minute of the trial. \u201cEveryone follows it,\u201d says Anna Gottschalk, who covered the trial most days for the Berlingske newspaper. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re at a caf\u00e9 or a family birthday, everyone knows this case.\u201d\n\nThe interest has also been international. The court had to open a special room with a video link to accommodate more than 115 journalists from 15 countries, drawn by the unusual suspect, with his rocket-building projects, and the macabre circumstances of Wall\u2019s death on his submarine.\n\nBuch-Jepsen believes Madsen strangled or beheaded Wall after torturing her to fulfil a violent sexual fantasy. The prosecutor read out and played a selection of more than 140 clips or links showing murder, torture, beheading and the sexual torture of women that were found by police on Madsen\u2019s computer, hard drives and among the reconstructed contents of his iPhone. The night before Wall\u2019s death, he Googled \u201cbeheading\u201d and \u201cgirl\u201d, and then watched a video of a girl having her throat slit.\n\nBut when Madsen gave his own account of how Wall died from asphyxiation after an accident caused the submarine to fill with exhaust fumes, he was so plausible that it was easy to see how he had convinced so many people that he could launch a manned space mission from a rusty hangar in a disused Copenhagen shipyard.\n\nWhen Buch-Jepsen read part of a text found on one of Madsen\u2019s hard drives about torturing women with skewers, the defendant maintained it was no different from a horror film. \u201cOf course it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Madsen said, ignoring the chilling parallels between the content and the wounds on Wall\u2019s body. \u201cIt\u2019s as crazy as the movie you\u2019ve seen, Seven. It\u2019s the same as films you\u2019ve seen, Jakob.\u201d\n\nCross-examined on how and why he cut off Wall\u2019s arms, legs and head, Madsen initially appeared subdued, calling it \u201ca very, very traumatic event, which I do not want to describe\u201d. Eventually he admitted he had no idea why it had been necessary to cut off Wall\u2019s head to remove her body from the submarine.\n\nKim Winther, an expert witness from the Danish Technological Institute, had told the court that Madsen\u2019s account of the accident was technically \u201cplausible\u201d, and questioned the claim made by a submarine expert that traces of carbon monoxide or soot would necessarily have been found in the submarine and its filters if his account was true.\n\nThe fact that forensic pathologists have been unable to determine the exact time or cause of Wall\u2019s death could also be a problem for the prosecution. However, Mette Grith Stage, who has defended some of Denmark\u2019s most high-profile murderers, told the Observer that the defence faced \u201can uphill struggle\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it any easier when he has all this material on his computer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe forensic pathologist found no signs of carbon monoxide poisoning on Wall\u2019s body, and determined that some of her wounds were inflicted when she was alive, or very shortly after death, rather than many hours later, as Madsen claims.\n\nThe biggest problem for the defence, Stage said, was Madsen\u2019s own shifting testimony, which has moved from a claim that he dropped Wall on land alive, to saying that she died when a heavy hatch fell on her head, to saying she died of asphyxiation. \u201cIn a case like this where you don\u2019t have any witnesses, it\u2019s very important that the defendant is trustworthy, and he was in the beginning,\u201d Stage said. \u201cBut every time the police came up with something new, he had to make a new explanation, and this has happened so many times that he\u2019s not trustworthy any more.\u201d\n\nThe verdict is due on Wednesday."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/21/identity-checks-election-disenfranchise-ethnic-minorities", "title": "Tories in new race row over identity checks for elections", "text": "Government plans that will force people to prove their identities at polling stations in May\u2019s local elections risk disenfranchising members of ethnic minority communities, according to a leaked letter to ministers from the equality and human rights watchdog.\n\nIn a move that will fuel controversy over the treatment of migrants in the UK following the Windrush scandal, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has written to the Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, raising its serious concern that the checks will deter immigrants and others from participating in the democratic process.\n\nThe Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the plan for compulsory checks was more evidence of the kind of \u201chostile environment\u201d that Theresa May\u2019s government wanted to create for people who had come to settle in Britain. In a speech on Sunday, Corbyn will claim that Theresa May\u2019s determination to cut immigration at all costs was responsible for the Windrush scandal. He will say: \u201cBritish citizens who came to our country to rebuild it after the war have faced deportation because they couldn\u2019t clear the deliberately unreachable bar set by Theresa May\u2019s \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for migrants.\u201d\n\nUnder the new government voting rules, being trialled in several local authorities at the 3 May local elections, people will be asked at polling stations to produce documents proving their identity \u2013 such as a passport or driving licence \u2013 before casting their vote. Currently, no such proof is required.\n\nThe Windrush scandal has highlighted how many who came to this country from the Caribbean, mainly in the late 1950s, have struggled to prove their British citizenship because the authorities failed to register them or destroyed their landing cards, or because they have never applied for documents such as passports.\n\nMinisters say the pilot projects are being run \u2013 with a view to adopting them nationwide if they are successful \u2013 in response to concerns about electoral fraud.\n\nBut in a letter to Lidington, and leaked to the Observer, the EHRC says evidence of supposed fraud is minimal and warns that there is a real risk that legal residents who might not have a passport or driving licence \u2013 or might be reluctant to produce them at polling stations \u2013 could be disenfranchised as a result.\n\nIn the letter, the EHRC\u2019s legal officer, Claire Collier, tells Lidington: \u201cThe Commission is concerned that the requirement to produce identification at the given local elections (Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking) will have a disproportionate impact on voters with protected characteristics, particularly older people, transgender people, people with disabilities and/or those from ethnic minority communities. In essence, there is a concern that some voters will be disenfranchised as a result of restrictive identification requirements.\u201d\n\nReacting to the news, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cForcing voters at election time to prove their identity at polling stations by producing official documents would have a disproportionate impact on people from black and ethnic minority communities.\n\n\u201cIt is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It\u2019s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.\u201d\n\nKunle Olulode, the director of Voice4Change England, a civil society charity that has worked with the government to improve the participation of BME communities in elections said: \u201cWe feel strongly that this type of policy will not only have minimal impact on the miniscule level of voting fraud but will create potentially new and unnecessary barriers to participation in the electoral process if people become uncertain of requirements when they turn up at polling stations, further impacting negatively on registrations. Asking for voters IDs as a policy certainly has echoes of the strategy aimed at making society an uncomfortable place for illegal migrants.\u201d\n\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe already ask that people prove who they are in order to collect a parcel from the post office, rent a car, or travel abroad.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is right to take the same approach to protect voting rights. Local authorities are implementing equality impact assessments and are working with partners to ensure that voter ID does not risk preventing any eligible voter from voting. It is in nobody\u2019s interest that any elector is disenfranchised.\u201d\n\nLast night John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, called for an inquiry into immigration policy and the Windrush scandal in which up to 50,000 mostly Commonwealth migrants are facing problems securing their citizenship, access to healthcare and other services because of Home Office demands to see proof of their rights to be here.\n\n\u201cThe truth is now out. Hard-working, tax-paying immigrants who were invited to this country to help with postwar reconstruction have been treated appallingly,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cIt is never too late to repent, but it is unwise for penitents to boast about their achievements. Instead, the government needs to set up an inquiry urgently to discover where other aspects of our immigration policy are treating people as less than human.\u201d\n\nIt has also emerged that the \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal immigrants was implemented despite warnings from a Tory cabinet minister that it would lead to exploitation and endanger health.\n\nInvestigations show that the plan to force landlords to check the immigration status of tenants, known as the \u201cright to rent\u201d, was fiercely opposed before its implementation by Eric Pickles, the former communities secretary. In an internal memo written in February 2013, he warned: \u201cIt would be disproportionately burdensome, ineffective and intrusive to oblige all private landlords to satisfy themselves as to the immigration status of prospective tenants. It\u2019s hard to assess how many illegal immigrants this policy would deter in practice as it would be easy to circumvent/evade detection.\n\n\u201cThose landlords/agents who are already rogues will not obey the law \u2013 and will make more money by exploiting a niche market in illegal tenants by increasing rents/compromising on health and safety for tenants who cannot complain ... The costs and risks considerably outweigh the benefits.\u201d\n\nAmber Rudd, the home secretary, appeared to blame her department for the Windrush scandal last week, saying: \u201cThe Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amber Rudd appeared to blame her officials for being \u2018too concerned with policy and strategy and losing sight of the individual\u2019.\n\nPhotograph: Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, Brodie Clark, the former head of the UK Borders Agency who resigned after being criticised by May in 2011 for relaxing passport checks to reduce immigration queues, condemned the decision to blame officials and pointed to a \u201cpolitical desperation\u201d to reduce immigration.\n\n\u201cIn my time with UKBA, I had the greatest regard for frontline staff and their ability to do their jobs effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw their job as defending the country, but doing it in a fair and decent fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo hear any political leader now saying, \u2018The trouble is, they were too obsessed in delivering policy and not enough about caring for people\u2019, just beggars belief. Civil servants are employed to deliver government policy and deviation is certainly not rewarded. It is a shameful shot, given the dedication, commitment and skill of those staff.\u201d\n\nThe National Landlords Association, the Residential Landlords Association and the lettings agents\u2019 body ARLA Propertymark are all pushing for the \u201cright to rent\u201d policy to be dropped amid warnings that it is causing landlords to discriminate against people with foreign names or non-UK passports. The policy was piloted from December 2014 and rolled out across England in February 2016.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cIt was a Labour government which, in 2008, introduced the labour market test so that people had to evidence their status. And it is fair that only those who have a right to be here can work legally, rent property and access public services.\u201d"}, {"link": "http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/21/mike-myers-verne-troyer-tribute/", "title": "Mike Myers pays tribute to <em>Austin Powers</em> costar Verne Troyer: \u2018I hope he is in a better place\u2019", "text": "Mike Myers has paid tribute to his Austin Powers costar Verne Troyer, who died Saturday at the age of 49.\n\n\u201cVerne was the consummate professional and a beacon of positivity for those of us who had the honor of working with him,\u201d the actor said in a statement. \u201cIt is a sad day, but I hope he is in a better place.

He\u2019s getting the best care possible and resting comfortably.\u201d\n\nThe statement posted on his Facebook page Saturday referred to the recent troubles. \u201cVerne was a fighter when it came to his own battles,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOver the years he\u2019s struggled and won, struggled and won, struggled and fought some more, but unfortunately this time was too much. During this recent time of adversity he was baptized while surrounded by his family.\u201d On April 6, 2017, Troyer wrote on Instagram that he had battled alcohol addiction in the past and that he was voluntarily checking himself into a treatment center. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not always been an easy fight, I\u2019m willing to continue my fight day by day,\u201d he wrote. Troyer became a celebrity and pop-culture phenomenon after starring alongside Myers as Mini-Me. Troyer, who was 2 feet 8 inches, was a versatile actor who was widely recognizable from his various roles. He played the goblin Griphook in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone and the ice hockey coach Punch Cherkov in The Love Guru. One of Troyer\u2019s first film roles came as a stunt double for a baby in the film Baby\u2019s Day Out (1994). He also appeared in Men in Black (1997), How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). He made headlines in 2008 when he sued celebrity news site TMZ and sought $20 million in damages for a sex tape Troyer said the website stole and posted online. His lawsuit said the tape was for his \u201cown personal, private use.\u201d Troyer had a YouTube channel with more than half a million subscribers on which he frequently posted comedy skits. In his last video, posted three weeks ago, Troyer was in an armchair and talked about his pet peeves. \u201cJust because I\u2019m small people think that they can come up to me and tap me on the head,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a lap dog.\u201d Myers wrote on Twitter: \u201cVerne was the consummate professional and a beacon of positivity for those of us who had the honor of working with him. It is a sad day, but I hope he is in a better place. He will be greatly missed.\u201d With files from the New York Times and The Associated Press"}, {"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/treme-new-orleans-jazz-fest-treme-petit-jazz-museum/", "title": "Preserving the relics found in Treme, the birthplace of jazz", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival -- better known as Jazz Fest -- kicks off next Friday.

He said \u2018I have a broken heart\u2019.\n\n\u201cBut this was not new \u2013 his depression had been causing him problems for the last three years.\u201c\n\nLast night police were still probing the death of the former BBC National Lottery host, whose body was found at his rented London home last Wednesday. Dale was just 62 years old.\n\nHis death is being treated as \u201cunexplained\u201d, but not suspicious.\n\nJohn said: \u201cIt is so sad. It is so hard to take it all in. Dale was such a great guy and deserved to go on living.\u201d\n\nHe and Dale became neighbours 13 years ago when the star bought a three-bedroom house in a gated community in Sarasota, Miami.\n\nIt is believed Dale had been living between the UK and Florida for the last 15 years, but he chose to spend the majority of his time in America to escape the glare of publicity.\n\nJohn said Dale loved to potter about his US home close to a golf course and could often be seen riding his bike around the neighbourhood.\n\nSpeaking from an armchair on his front lawn, father-of-three John said: \u201cWe have talked and joked with each other so many times over the years \u2013 but I always knew it would not last.\n\n\u201cI always worried that Dale would take his own life one day, just like his mother.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I always thought he would not die of natural causes.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nJohn believes Dale\u2019s failed relationship led to his decline.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe just could not get over this guy.\n\n\u201cHe really must have been in love with the man and I think the depression of his break-up is what killed him. Every time we spoke over the past three years he would always talk about it.\n\n\u201cHe was such a happy guy at first, but then I saw the life sucked out of him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say \u2018Hey Dale, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 And he would respond with stuff like, \u2018Oh I\u2019m depressed, it is all too much\u2019.\n\nOn some occasions, he\u2019d go back to being his old self and scream, \u2018I am fabulous\u2019 as he cycled past me. But then I would see the happiness just drain straight back out of him again.\n\n\u201cI tried to tell him to get over it, but he just could not do it.\u201d\n\nDale\u2019s mental deterioration was mirrored by his physical health.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nJohn said the star became \u201csickly thin\u201d as his shoulder and back problems worsened and he even struggled to ride his beloved bicycle around the block.\n\nDale was also a chain smoker, which caused him such severe breathing \u00addifficulties that John had to help him install a home ventilation device.\n\nHe said: \u201cDale\u2019s health got worse. His shoulder was bad, he had back problems and he could hardly breathe because he smoked four packets of cigarettes a day.\n\n\u201cHe got so thin over the past few months and he looked really quite ill.\n\n\u201cI think he really struggled with his physical appearance.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cWhen I first met Dale, he loved to be flamboyant and pretty, but towards the end I think he was embarrassed by the way he looked.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible to see him like that. Dale still tried to bring joy into my life as that is what he loved to do. But sometimes he would not leave the house.\n\n\u201cI would check in to make sure he had not done something bad.\n\n\u201cI honestly think the only thing that could have saved his life is if he had managed to find someone else to help mend his heart.\u201d\n\nBefore Dale\u2019s \u201cdeadly downward spiral\u201d John said the star lived a fun-filled life in the Sunshine State.\n\nHe enjoyed driving a fleet of exotic motors, including dozens of Land Rovers, Bentleys and Jaguars.\n\nJohn revealed Dale liked to have bundles of cash piled high throughout his home and jewellery scattered all over the furniture.\n\nHe also had thousands of his \u201cspecial cigarettes\u201d delivered from the UK.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nAccording to John, the In It To Win It presenter would go on regular trips to Miami and frequented a number of gay bars in the area.\n\nBefore his devastating break-up, Dale often had men \u201cof all varieties\u201d visiting his home and John once even joked with the star that he was a \u201cchubby chaser\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cNot a lot of people know this, but Dale was really into politics.\n\n\u201cWe could sit and chat about it for hours. He was a Trump supporter. He almost had the same tan as Trump.\n\n\u201cIn fact Dale was so tanned that sometimes I did not know whether I should shake his hand or peel him.\n\n\u201cDale also loved his luxury cars and was always getting new ones delivered. He loved the British brands.\n\n\u201cHe was a rich guy who loved to enjoy life. I once went into his home and saw wads of cash piled high. It was 50s and 100s.\n\n\u201cHe had beautiful jewellery and nice watches all over the place. He loved the finer things in life.\u201d\n\nTelly star Dale saw his popularity soar throughout the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nHe was always a consummate TV professional, but in recent years he kept a low profile as rumours of his poor heath began to circulate.\n\nThis year he tried to relaunch his career with Channel 5 show Dale\u2019s Florida Fly Drive, but he died before the series was shown in full.\n\nJohn believes the star always \u00adstruggled with the pressures of fame.\n\nHe said: \u201cDale was a sweetheart, he was a guy who always wanted to be seen in the light \u2013 but he didn\u2019t always want to shine.\n\n\u201cSometimes he wanted to turn that light off. He loved the fame but he also wanted to get away from it.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing was though, if you had no idea who he was, he definitely made sure you would find out.\n\n\u201cBut here he could be himself, I think it is the only time he could be.\n\n\u201cI will always miss him.\u201d"}, {"link": "http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/21/firewatch-developer-campo-santo-acquired-by-valve", "title": "Firewatch Developer Campo Santo Acquired by Valve - IGN", "text": "Share. \u201cWe will maintain our jobs as video game developers and continue production on our current project, In the Valley of Gods.\u201d \u201cWe will maintain our jobs as video game developers and continue production on our current project, In the Valley of Gods.\u201d\n\nFirewatch developer Canto Santo has been acquired by Valve.\n\nA post on Campo Santo\u2019s official site explains that the company\u2019s 12 employees have \u201cagreed to join Valve\u201d and will \u201cmaintain our jobs as video game developers and continue production on our current project, In the Valley of Gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a series of long conversations with the people at Valve and everyone shared the satisfaction we take in working with people whose talents dwarf our own to make things we never thought possible,\u201d the post reads. \u201cBoth sides spoke about our values and how, when you get right down to it, we, as human beings, are hard-limited by the time we have left when it comes to making the things we care about and believe in.

I assumed that no unwell person would ever find themself having to explain their condition to doctors who had never heard of it before. I assumed that doctors could not refuse to treat someone who was unwell, or would not ask that unwell person to convince them \u2013 often over several weeks \u2013 why they should do so. I assumed that treatment cures illness, or at least does not do harm; that medicines are prescribed precisely and not by trial and error. But most of all, I assumed that when a person became unwell, their medical expenses would be taken care of. We have a public healthcare system, after all \u2013 and our politicians speak so often of fairness and the fair go \u2013 and it is never a sick person\u2019s fault that they are unwell, and so it seemed ridiculous that they would be penalised for something already so punishing.\n\n\n\nThis is, essentially, just a gentler way of saying that I had the privilege to be incredibly naive. When I consider now all of the money I have spent across the seven years that I was in active treatment for my illness, seven years when media commentary about the irresponsibility and instant gratification of my generation has continually intensified, I often think: if I could eat avocado toast, I\u2019d be able to afford a house by now.\n\nExisting between the lines: getting to know my daughter's dyslexia | Angie Fox Read more\n\n*\n\nIn many ways, I\u2019ve been particularly unlucky \u2013 anorexia is a notoriously difficult illness to treat, especially in adults, and requires a barrage of therapists, practitioners and specialists. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses; it\u2019s estimated that recovery takes an average of seven years. In the early stages of treatment, it\u2019s best to see a psychologist twice a week \u2013 because sitting down to eat six times a day when everything in your body and being screams against doing so is an incredibly difficult thing to do, and it\u2019s almost impossible to stay on track without this kind of support every couple of days.\n\nBefore I asked my family to step in and help, I\u2019d been living on less than $50 every week after rent and medical bills \u2013 not to mention the fact that part of my treatment involved trying to eat out occasionally, or buying coffee made on full-cream milk every day for a week.\n\n\n\nI remember talking about this with one of my friends from hospital, who was also a student, and working part-time as a nurse, who\u2019d sought financial aid from her university in the form of $20 Coles gift vouchers. We\u2019d both found it difficult to ask for help \u2013 in no small part, I think, because anorexia is always underpinned by a fierce striving for needlessness, for independence \u2013 and my friend phrased the problem like this: I can afford to learn how to eat, but then I can\u2019t afford to eat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I often think: if I could eat avocado toast, I\u2019d be able to afford a house by now.\u2019 Photograph: Sarka Babicka/Getty Images\n\nEvery single first time I see a psychologist, a psychiatrist, a dietitian, I have to explain the unusual circumstances of my illnesses, the physical rumination \u2013 a mechanical tic in my stomach that responds to certain foods \u2013 that underpins the psychological anorexia. Each time they tell me they\u2019ve never seen a case of rumination before \u2013 it\u2019s rare that they\u2019ve even heard of it. Each time this process takes the best part of an hour; each time we\u2019re left with barely 10 minutes for the clinician to begin to give advice. Each time I spend almost the entire appointment educating them, usually armed with fact sheets or research papers or printed-out extracts from medical textbooks. That\u2019s all we have time for today, they always say. I\u2019ve had to pay \u2013 full-price \u2013 on the way in.\n\nMedicare \u2013 for now \u2013 covers most GP appointments, although it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to find a good GP with mental health nous who still bulk-bills. But for everything else, it\u2019s terribly inadequate. A rebate for a psychiatrist appointment is $156.15, when the appointment itself costs about $350. In each year, one person is allocated up to 10 psychology rebates \u2013 eating disorder patients need about nine times this. I usually run out of rebates by the end of March.\n\nOver my seven years of treatment, I\u2019ve calculated \u2013 taking into account all of these rebates, but not including my health insurance premiums or the cost of my medications, both of which have changed too many times to keep track of \u2013 that I\u2019ve spent more than $75,000 \u2013 which is the equivalent of 18,750 avocadoes, by the way. Or 10 full years of cafe breakfasts, every single day.\n\nI don\u2019t think of this as wasted money. I have learned a lot and changed a lot, even if my illness is still with me, and probably will be for life. Had I not spent this money, I\u2019d almost certainly have died. But these bills never should have been mine to pay.\n\n*\n\nIn 2012, the Butterfly Foundation published a report on the economic impact of eating disorders in Australia. They found that eating disorders affected about 4% of our population (an estimated 913,986 people), and that taken together, these people paid $592.2m in health system and other costs related to their disease in just one year.\n\nMy friend phrased the problem like this: 'I can afford to learn how to eat, but then I can\u2019t afford to eat'\n\nThis is a staggering amount of money in any circumstance, but it becomes all the more incomprehensible when the other factors that make up the \u201cburden of disease\u201d are taken into account. Many people with mental illnesses work only part-time or casually, if they\u2019re able to work at all; they have greater rates of absenteeism (because all of those appointments take up time) and presenteeism (which is when you show up for work but don\u2019t actually do anything \u2013 like when I used to try and proofread with a brain so undernourished I could barely concentrate for five minutes at a time); there are also informal care costs and sick leave (itself unimaginable for those of us who are self-employed).\n\nWith these factors included, the Butterfly Foundation estimates the socioeconomic cost of eating disorders to be $69.7bn each year. 89% cent of this cost is borne by individuals, with governments \u2013 federal and state combined \u2013 covering barely more than 7%. The rest of the burden falls on families and friends, employers, and a nebulous category called \u201csociety/other\u201d.\n\nI once went to the pharmacy in September to fill my monthly scripts; the woman at the register wore bright green lipstick and had a row of similarly-colourful lipsticks on the counter in front of her. She scanned my medications, said that\u2019s $83, and, in the same breath, would you like to buy a coloured lipstick to raise money for women\u2019s mental health?\n\n\n\n*\n\nI stopped getting regular treatment for my illness partway through last year. I didn\u2019t realise until I did this just how much the financial anxiety of meeting the costs of my treatment was contributing to the generalised anxiety that\u2019s part and parcel of my illness; didn\u2019t fully appreciate how stressful managing these constant payments had been until I was no longer checking my bank balance and making calculations almost every other day. The relief was almost physical.\n\nThis story, though, is not just mine. As well as that estimated 4% of the population with eating disorders, it\u2019s estimated that 20% of people in this country will struggle with mental ill health at some stage in their lives; physical illnesses can and do also incur incredible expenses, and often trigger anxiety and depression in the people who live with them as well.\n\nMy life became entwined with a stranger in a tense mid-air drama | Ranjana Srivastava Read more\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: access to healthcare \u2013 to affordable, timely and quality healthcare \u2013 is a human right, and our country\u2019s laws explicitly state that it is the government\u2019s responsibility to \u201ccreate conditions\u201d which \u201cassure to all medical service and medical attention\u201d. I already had terrible trouble accessing services and treatment because of the complex nature and the rarity of my condition; and it seems even more obscene that economic access should have been an issue as well. The financial burden of treatment should never have been added to the physical and mental burden of my illness. The system itself is pathological and it is punishing, and within it, I certainly found, it is very difficult to become well.\n\n\u2022 This is an edited version of the article If I Could Eat Avocado Toast, I\u2019d be Able to Afford a House by Now that originally appeared in the literary magazine Kill Your Darlings"}, {"link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pippa-middleton-pregnant-first-child-12405551", "title": "Pippa Middleton 'pregnant with her first child' with financier husband", "text": "Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

He has yet to impose any preconditions on his meeting with Mr. Kim, not even the release of three Americans who are being held in North Korea, though officials say the United States is working hard to get them out.\n\nThis past week, he endorsed Mr. Kim\u2019s effort to reach a peace accord with South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, which would formally end the 68-year military conflict in Korea. Inside the White House, some worry that Mr. Kim will use promises of peace to peel South Korea away from the United States and blunt efforts to force him to give up his nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the Korean War has not ended,\u201d Mr. Trump said with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan sitting next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s going on right now. And they are discussing an end to the war. So, subject to a deal, they would certainly have my blessing.\u201d\n\nMr. Abe pointedly did not echo those sentiments. Japan is deeply skeptical of Mr. Kim\u2019s motives, and worried that its security concerns may not be taken into account in any agreement between either North and South Korea, or North Korea and the United States.\n\nJapanese officials dismissed North Korea\u2019s announcement that it was suspending nuclear and missile tests as \u201cnot sufficient\u201d because it did not clearly state whether it included the short- and midrange missiles that are capable of hitting Japanese territory.\n\n\u201cJust because North Korea is responding to dialogue, there should be no reward,\u201d Mr. Abe said after spending two days with Mr. Trump at his Palm Beach estate in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. \u201cMaximum pressure should be maintained, and actual implementation of concrete actions towards denuclearization will be demanded.\u201d\n\nEven China, which is accustomed to controlling its relationship with North Korea without interference from other powers, is chafing at the speed of events, and the increasingly warm feelings between Pyongyang and Washington. Chinese officials fear that they will be sidelined in negotiations and that Mr. Kim will pursue a deal with the United States that places the North closer to Washington than Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMuch of the anxiety in Tokyo and Beijing stems from the unpredictability of the main players. Mr. Trump, who threatened in August to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the North, is now talking about \u201cgood will\u201d between Washington and Pyongyang. Mr. Kim has proved more adroit than many expected in orchestrating the diplomatic opening to South Korea and the United States.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing a great job of appearing reasonable, but picking apart the maximum pressure campaign, and positioning themselves to be accepted as a nuclear weapons state in the future,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is the flux on Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team. Days after accepting Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet, the president fired his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, was forced to step down.\n\nNow, Mr. Trump has entrusted the diplomacy to Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, whom he nominated to replace Mr. Tillerson and who is embroiled in a difficult Senate confirmation process. Mr. Pompeo traveled secretly to Pyongyang over Easter weekend to meet Mr. Kim, bringing along only aides from the spy agency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But much of his one-day visit was devoted to logistical issues, like the venue and date for a meeting, which is expected in late May or early June. The lack of involvement by the White House or the State Department, another official said, has limited the amount of substantive preparation for the meeting with Mr. Kim.\n\nGeneral McMaster\u2019s hawkish successor, John R. Bolton, is another wild card. Two weeks before he was recruited as national security adviser, he said a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim was useful only because it would inevitably fail, and then the United States could move swiftly on to the next phase \u2014 presumably a military confrontation.\n\n\u201cIt could be a long and unproductive meeting, or it could be a short and unproductive meeting,\u201d he said on Fox News.\n\nSince entering the White House, however, Mr. Bolton has stuck to a traditional definition of his job, brokering proposals to present to Mr. Trump, officials said. Even among officials who worry about war, there is sympathy for his view that \u201cfailing quickly\u201d would be valuable. The United States, they said, should flush out Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions before he has another six months or a year to master intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s presence has also not stopped Mr. Trump from praising Mr. Kim and voicing optimism \u2014 even excitement \u2014 about their looming encounter. On Friday, he tweeted, \u201cNorth Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World \u2014 big progress! Look forward to our Summit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration viewed Mr. Kim\u2019s statement about halting nuclear tests as more intriguing than his acceptance of a continuing American troop presence because he made it to his own people. Still, they noted his unwillingness to rule out short- and medium-range missiles, which they said could divide Japan from the United States.\n\nOfficials also acknowledged the challenge of staying in sync with Mr. Moon, who is acting as a mediator between the United States and North Korea and who is deeply invested in ending years of estrangement between the North and South.\n\nMr. Moon contends that it would not be difficult to broker a \u201cbroad\u201d agreement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in which North Korea commits to giving up its arsenal and the United States makes security guarantees, including a peace treaty and normalized ties, and offers aid that Mr. Kim needs to rebuild his economy.\n\nSouth Korea envisions a sequential process, starting with an agreement to freeze North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and ending with total denuclearization. The North, officials said, will insist that for each step it takes, the United States offer reciprocal incentives.\n\nSuch an approach is not new: The George W. Bush administration tried it with Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, in 2005. But the process could be open-ended if North Korea and the United States, mistrustful of each other, haggle each step of the way, as they did then.\n\nThe key to success, South Korean officials said, is if North Korea and the United States can agree to narrow the time span between the initial freeze, which Mr. Moon has called \u201cthe entrance,\u201d and complete denuclearization, which he calls \u201cthe exit.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean officials are banking on Mr. Kim\u2019s desperate desire to improve the economy and Mr. Trump\u2019s need for a diplomatic victory before the midterm elections in November.\n\nOnce they reach a broad deal, analysts said, Mr. Kim could move to dismantle production facilities for intercontinental ballistic missiles and allow access to nuclear sites in the North; the two leaders could exchange liaison offices in Pyongyang and Washington; and Mr. Trump could ease sanctions, especially those that affect ordinary North Koreans.\n\nLike their American counterparts, South Korean officials do not believe that Mr. Kim will swiftly relinquish his nuclear weapons. But there is a growing belief in Seoul that he might ultimately bargain them away, if it helps him rebuild the economy. That is why some in South Korea viewed his announcement on testing as a hopeful sign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt means that North Korea is willing to give up an ICBM capability that threatens the United States,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea. \u201cThis is why it is good news for the Trump administration.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.nhl.com/news/columbus-blue-jackets-washington-capitals-game-5-recap/c-298178818", "title": "Backstrom's OT goal helps Capitals top Blue Jackets in Game 5", "text": "Backstrom had two goals, Evgeny Kuznetsov and T.J.

Instead, she was in Houston, Texas, to pay her respects to one of her predecessors, Barbara Bush.\n\nThe current first lady sat among several former presidents and first ladies in the pews at St. Martin's Episcopal Church for Bush's funeral service on Saturday, including former President Barack Obama, whom her husband, President Donald Trump, has often criticized. Michelle Obama was there, too; in January, she joked on a talk show about the way Mrs. Trump awkwardly handed her a gift box on the steps of the White House on Inauguration Day. Mrs. Trump hasn't seen or spoken to either Obama since then.\n\nAlso nearby was former first lady and 2016 presidential rival Hillary Clinton, a favorite target of the President's tweets, in which he likes to call her \"Crooked Hillary,\" ribbing his former rival about investigations and emails.\n\nAnd, naturally, there were many Bush family attendees. The President's constant primary campaign target, Jeb Bush, whom Trump nicknamed \"low energy,\" delivered a eulogy to his mother.\n\nIn other words, the first lady was literally, and voluntarily, walking into a den of potential adversaries. But as has become a trademark reaction to the drama surrounding her husband, Melania Trump didn't let on that she cares about any of it, and she certainly wasn't letting it stop her.\n\n\"She was invited to attend and intends to pay her respects to not only Barbara Bush, but the entire family,\" the first lady's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told CNN, adding Trump is \"a confident woman. ... I know politics will not be an issue.\"\n\nThe President was invited, too. But almost two days after his wife confirmed she would be attending the memorial service for Mrs. Bush, the West Wing released a statement saying the President would not, citing a desire not to cause undo disruption.\n\nThe services for Mrs. Bush capped a week that included hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife for two days at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, culminating in a dinner for the couple -- a smaller dry-run, perhaps, for the mountainous task of the full state dinner that lies ahead in Washington.\n\nState Dinner prep\n\nPlanning for Tuesday's state dinner, being held in honor of the official visit of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, began months ago; it was then that Melania Trump started to think of the details, such as an ideal gift.\n\nCNN has learned one of those gifts will be a framed section of upholstery from one of the chairs in the White House Blue Room. Featuring a golden eagle surrounded by laurels, the chair was part of the furniture suite inspired by Pierre-Antoine Bellang\u00e9, who designed royal palaces in France and created the 53 carved and gilded pieces for the Blue Room, which he was commissioned to create by President James Monroe. Monroe had previously served as a diplomat in France and had taken a shine to French d\u00e9cor. Though President James Buchanan got rid of the set in a redecoration decades later, it was first lady Jackie Kennedy who found the spare pieces and brought them back during her quest to restore the White House. Kennedy worked with a French designer to reproduce missing items, including recreating the fabric through French textile firm Tassinari and Ch\u00e2tel.\n\nThe Marcrons will also receive from the Trumps a special photo album upon their departure, with pictures of their visit, as well as a Tiffany & Co. silver bowl, engraved with the presidential seal and the signatures of both Trumps.\n\nThe first lady has often sought to highlight history as she puts her stamp on White House events, say those familiar with her process.\n\nDespite her willingness to buck precedent -- arriving solo to Trump's State of the Union address, for example -- a person familiar with Melania Trump's work in the White House said protocol is paramount, as is preserving tradition. That thoughtfulness is being reciprocated by the Macrons, as CNN has learned the Trumps will be gifted a four-and-a-half-foot tall European sessile oak sapling that will be planted in Belleau Wood, in Aisne, France, site of a landmark World War I battle in June 1918, where nearly 10,000 US Marines and Army soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\nFirst Lady takes charge\n\nSo confident was Trump about her ability to handle something like a state dinner, with its myriad details, that the first lady would not hire an event planner to help, as previous first ladies have done in the past to manage the grandeur and spectacle.\n\nFor example, the final state dinner of the Obama administration, its 14th, was a tented affair for former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, held on the South Lawn of the White House for 400 guests. Michelle Obama wore a custom, chainmail Atelier Versace gown; Mario Batali cooked, and Gwen Stefani entertained.\n\nFor the Trump administration's first state dinner, there will be none of that. There will also be none of the paparazzi element that has come with past state dinners; celebrity supporters of the President are harder to come by than they were for Obama.\n\n\"A smaller, more elegant event allows a guest to have a more personal experience, and that is very important to Mrs. Trump,\" said Grisham, who confirmed the dinner will take place in the State Dining Room, which can hold about 100-150 seated guests.\n\n\"[The first lady] has a background in design, which played a major role in the d\u00e9cor throughout the State floor,\" Grisham adds of Trump's hands-on approach. \"She has been very focused on the experience of the guests, and wants to ensure they are able to truly enjoy and remember the occasion. When you are invited to a dinner at the White House, it is very special to be able to sit in the State Dining Room. After all, this is the People's house, which is rich with history and tradition.\"\n\nCurrent White House social secretary Rickie Niceta told CNN that Trump was aware the selection of the State Dining Room would limit the number of invitations, which could fuel criticism, but Trump \"held firm\" to the idea.\"\n\nNiceta added that part of her job on behalf of the first lady is to make sure guests \"feel special and welcome from the moment they arrived to how they will be bid 'goodnight.\"\n\nOne person who didn't give input on the night is the President.\n\n\"The President has been busy with his schedule. The first lady took all preparations for the state dinner under her own wing,\" said Grisham.\n\nMrs. Trump has also been doing some homework, educating herself about the protocol and history of these sorts of White House events. This is to ensure her selections for the Macrons' visit have meaning behind them, down to the china, flowers, color scheme and menu, which, while American, will highlight the influence France has had on American cuisine.\n\n\"Mrs. Trump selected every item and every detail for the dinner, from the entr\u00e9e to the chair cushions,\" said Niceta.\n\nIt's an indicator that the first lady, who moved to Washington full time only last June, seems to have gotten the hang of running an operation as massive as the White House.\n\n\"She has a solid grasp on all of her roles, which include mother, wife and first lady of the United States, both public-facing with events and engagements and behind-the-scenes with the renovations and preservation efforts at the White House,\" Grisham said.\n\nMelania's team is \"small, but mighty\"\n\nTrump has amassed a staff that has yet to experience the massive turnover happening in the West Wing. Stories of palace intrigue and heads on the chopping block don't emanate from the East Wing.\n\n\"We are a close-knit team,\" said Grisham.\n\nThey have lost at least three members -- two operations and advance directors, and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former Manhattan-based senior adviser to Trump. The first lady unceremoniously cut ties with Wolkoff in February after it was revealed Wolkoff's events firm received more than $26 million for the work it did for the inauguration, a job unrelated to her duties for the first lady.\n\n\"We are currently at a staff of 10,\" said Grisham. \"The team is small, but mighty.\"\n\n\"We are close-knit, we laugh lot,\" Niceta adds. \"We are family.\"\n\nAs a boss, Trump is regarded as a straight shooter and is well liked by executive residence staff, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. Trump hasn't had the same level of public drama as her husband, whose West Wing hiring and firing foibles are frequently dissected by the media.\n\nManaging the storm\n\nOf course, considering the barrage of salacious headlines surrounding the President and his alleged affairs, it is somewhat understandable the first lady isn't particularly eager to make herself more accessible to the public -- something her predecessor, Michelle Obama, did with expertise.\n\nIt is a delicate push and pull, the role of first lady.\n\nWhile undefined and unsalaried, it is still expected that the American people feel a connection to the partner of their leader, and a very private woman like Trump, unskilled and unfamiliar in the shoes of political spousehood, is still learning those ropes.\n\n\"She does value her privacy and that of her family, which is to be expected\" said Grisham, who adds she doesn't let it interfere with her work.\n\nThere has even been a rampant rumor circulating for months in the power circles of Washington that Trump might be spending time in a home rented by her parents in a ritzy suburb in order to avoid life inside the White House bubble.\n\nGrisham adamantly denies the gossip, and the house. \"No such place exists,\" she said.\n\nAs for the stories that spew like water from a fire hose about chaos in the West Wing, alleged affairs, payoffs and investigations, Trump has chosen not to comment. And just as we've learned that she opted out of a South Lawn walk or Marine One ride with her husband in order to take her own separate motorcade -- and what that might mean -- the first couple was spotted on a date night on the patio of Mar-a-Lago, or at Trump's eponymous Washington hotel.\n\nThe dynamics of her marriage remain a mystery, but Grisham said Trump's own independent streak has provided strength in the face of so much judgment.\n\n\"She is accustomed to being in the headlines and recognizes the scrutiny that comes with it,\" she said."}, {"link": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/asiawmclain/19-hilariously-awkward-things-doctors-midwives-and-nurses", "title": "19 Hilariously Awkward Things Doctors, Midwives, And Nurses Have Done During Childbirths", "text": "12.\n\n\"I had to be induced, which meant having a medication inserted vaginally.

However, the public can make a submission to the environment and energy department about potential threatened species listings during the listing process.\n\nDocuments published by the environment and energy department obtained under freedom of information laws show the Tasmanian Liberal deputy premier and former primary industries and water minister, Jeremy Rockliff, a federal Liberal senator, Jonathon Duniam, and the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association urged Frydenberg not to approve a critically endangered listing for the black gum or Brookers gum woodlands in that state.\n\nThis unprecedented political intervention into scientific process is absurd Evan Quartermain, Humane Society International\n\nThey argued doing so would impose unnecessary regulation on farmers and duplicate existing state laws.\n\nAn environment and energy department briefing states that available evidence shows Tasmanian black gum and Brookers gum forest has declined by 90% and provides vital habitat to 30 animals and 32 plants listed as nationally threatened, including the Tasmanian devil and quolls.\n\nIn its letter to Frydenberg, the farmers and graziers association said the threatened species scientific committee\u2019s conservation advice about the woodland community \u201clacks rigour\u201d.\n\nIn a letter from May last year, Rockliff said, \u201cI consider that the socioeconomic implications need to be considered against the likely limited additional environmental benefit from the proposed commonwealth listing of these ecological communities, which are already adequately protected and regulated under Tasmanian legislation.\u201d He added he had sent similar letters to then deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and Duniam.\n\nIn a reply to Rockliff in July 2017, Frydenberg said most public submissions supported granting a critically endangered listing, including those from state forestry and natural resource agencies.\n\nIn December Frydenberg deferred his decision to June 2018 to \u201cappropriately consider the listing advice and public comments received\u201d.\n\nEmbed\n\nThe same batch of FOI documents shows that the NSW Farmers Association, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and the NSW Irrigators\u2019 Council lobbied Frydenberg not to grant critically endangered status to the poplar box grassy woodlands community recommended for listing in NSW and Queensland. Frydenberg has twice deferred deciding to enact the scientific committee\u2019s recommendations and has deferred his listing decision until May.\n\nInformation on the environment and energy department\u2019s website says the deferral is \u201cto allow time for the [threatened species scientific] committee to provide updated advice incorporating newly available information, and to consider that advice prior to making a listing decision\u201d.\n\nNSW Farmers said it \u201cdoes not support the [act\u2019s] listing process, and it is not clear how or where the farming community\u2019s input is considered throughout this process\u201d.\n\nHumane Society International\u2019s head of programs, Evan Quartermain, said Frydenberg had a responsibility to act on the recommendations of the threatened species scientific committee.\n\n\u201cThis unprecedented political intervention into scientific process is absurd,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf habitats and the unique species that rely on them are under threat of extinction, it\u2019s simply a fact.

The focus is not on vegetation management as is the case with state laws, but on protecting nationally threatened matters and promoting support to landholders through environmental funding.\u201d\n\nRelease of the documents comes at the same time the federal government has launched an independent inquiry into the interaction between agriculture and the act.\n\nFrydenberg did not respond to specific questions from Guardian Australia about his reasons for deferring a decision on whether to grant the woodlands\u2019 critically endangered status.\n\nIn a statement, he said: \u201cAustralia has a spectacular natural environment which needs to be protected and nurtured for future generations to enjoy.\n\n\u201cThe independent review into the interaction between environmental law and the agricultural sector is about getting the balance right to deliver the best environmental and economic outcomes.\n\n\u201cIt builds on the Productivity Commission\u2019s 2017 report into the regulation of Australian agriculture which found that improvements could be made to reduce the complexity of regulation and the actions requiring compliance with the act.\u201d\n\nNeither Rockliff nor Duniam responded to specific questions.\n\nA Tasmanian government spokesperson, on behalf of Rockliff, said: \u201cAs Tasmanians would expect, we are ensuring our concerns are raised in Canberra.\n\n\u201cTasmania has a strong and growing agricultural industry and through our comprehensive sustainable agrifood plan we are working closely with our farmers and agribusiness to ensure the sector continues to thrive.\u201d\n\nA NSW Farmers spokeswoman said environmental laws were \u201ctoo complex for farmers to navigate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is overlapping state and federal legislation and a range of different agencies all involved in delivering and administering different aspects of it,\u201d she said.\n\nComment was sought from the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association and not supplied."}, {"link": "https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/video/1216392259726", "title": "Yonder Alonso\u2019s monster home run leaves Camden Yards (VIDEO)", "text": "- And they touch them for eight runs in four and 1/3.\n\n- Alonso gets in to one!

It is a sad day, but I hope he is in a better place. He will be greatly missed.\"\n\nTroyer grew up in an Amish community in Michigan and rose to fame as a result of his role as Mini-Me in the Austin Powers series. Following his Austin Powers debut in 1999's The Spy Who Shagged Me, he played Griphook in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Coach Punch Cherkov in The Love Guru. He also had guest spots on Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Scrubs, Two and a Half Men and Boston Public. He also memorably appeared as Mini-Me in the music video for Ludacris' \"Number One Spot\" from the 2004 album The Red Light District.\n\nIn a 2016 story for THR, Troyer spoke about the difficulties of being an actor who was short in stature; at two foot eight, he held the record for being the shortest actor.\n\n\u201cI was once offered a superhero role \u2014 it\u2019s almost too stupid to talk about \u2014 where when I came out to save lives, it was from under Abraham Lincoln\u2019s hat.

Footage of drunken antics from a reality show The Surreal Life went viral. \"That was a bad period in my life,\" Troyer told THR in 2016 of his years spent drinking. \"I've learned from it, and I move on.\"\n\nThe actor had suffered some recent health setbacks. In 2017, Troyer announced that he was receiving treatment for alcohol addiction on his Facebook page. \"I've been receiving treatment for the last week and I am voluntarily checking into a treatment center later this week to continue to get the help that I need,\" he wrote. In 2015 the actor suffered a seizure but quickly bounced back, telling fans that he was fine; his manager said he had gone to a hospital as a precautionary measure.\n\nOn Saturday several stars penned tributes to the actor upon hearing the news of his death. Music video collaborator Ludacris wrote on Instagram, \"R.I.P. Verne Troyer aka Mini Me.

They are the anchors of funfair rides, feature in extravagant floral tributes to the country\u2019s \u201cdear\u201d and \u201csupreme\u201d leaders from the Kim dynasty, and appear on stamps, apartment buildings and school walls.\n\nThese celebrations of the country\u2019s weapons programme serve as a constant reminder to residents and visitors of how critical North Korea\u2019s nuclear project has been to its national identity and security.\n\nNorth Korea halts nuclear and missile tests ahead of planned Trump summit Read more\n\nPursued at immense political and financial cost for more than six decades, even through a famine that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, it has proved useful leverage for wringing aid out of world powers, and an increasingly vital security guarantee for a brutal, autocratic regime.\n\nSo the unilateral promise by the leader Kim Jong-un to halt tests of nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and shut down the country\u2019s nuclear test site, was an unexpected commitment that has added to hopes for talks with US and South Korean counterparts.\n\nIt capped months of dramatic diplomacy that have seen Kim and Donald Trump pivot from trading belligerent threats to planning their summit and claiming a shared goal of getting rid of nuclear weapons.\n\nBut experts on North Korea warned that Kim\u2019s statement should be seen more as diplomatic manoeuvring, with relatively limited real costs to Pyongyang, than as a prelude to any genuine moves to gut the prized nuclear programme.\n\nKim is under huge pressure. For the first time in decades North Korea may actually fear an American military attack, and its fragile economy is at huge risk from the strictest sanctions it has ever faced.\n\nEven on a carefully choreographed tour of the capital, long-standing shortages and privations are clear. A handful of cars and buses drift down vast empty streets, solar panels hanging from windows and balconies are testimony to regular power cuts.\n\nKim needs trade to start flowing again, to fill his government coffers and the purses of supporters now grown used to moderate luxuries such as designer handbags, foreign whiskey and taxis to whisk them across town.\n\nHe may be willing to make some genuine concessions for this; an improvement on past talks where Pyongyang has blustered and ultimately offered little more than a return to the status quo. But they will not include America\u2019s stated aim \u2013 the total and irreversible destruction of the nuclear programme. The fate of other dictators who confronted America, but gave up weapons programmes, including Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, has not gone unnoticed.\n\nNorth Korea would be crazy to give up their nuclear deterrent when they have an aggressive nuclear-armed enemy Alex Wellerstein\n\n\u201cPeople like to talk about North Korea as \u2018crazy\u2019. The absolute \u2018craziest\u2019 thing they could do is give up their nuclear deterrent in a situation where they have an aggressive nuclear-armed enemy,\u201d Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science and nuclear weapons and a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology, said. \u201cDoes anyone think they are that crazy? I don\u2019t,\u201d he added.\n\nPyongyang\u2019s aims were still unclear he said, but could include stalling to defuse tensions, seeking recognition from America that it has long felt it deserves, or negotiating to reduce sanctions.\n\nFor now, though, Kim appears focused on making it through the summits. For weeks there have been questions on both sides of the Pacific about whether the meeting with Trump in particular would actually go ahead. It is apparently so sensitive that it has not been reported in North Korean state media. But the CIA chief Mike Pompeo\u2019s visit to Pyongyang, for personal meetings with Kim two weeks ago, appears to have brought a sometimes improbable meeting one step closer to reality.\n\nThe two men appear to have outlined a deal of sorts that would give both sides grounds to claim success even if little real progress is made on removing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the Wall Street Journal reported. Effectively it would see Kim swap the three Americans in his jails for the prestige of meeting the US president, something North Korean leaders have craved for decades.\n\nThe Americans are academics at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which was founded by a Korean-American Christian, and a businessman charged with spying and stealing state secrets in 2016 \u2013 the 62-year-old was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour.\n\nThat agreement, and Pyongyang\u2019s apparent show of goodwill over weapons testing, appear to make the high-profile summit more likely. But details still have to be hammered out. North Korea has agreed to constraints on its nuclear programme before and then backed away from commitments.\n\nIf Trump strikes a deal with North Korea, I\u2019ll be delighted. But don\u2019t hold your breath | Jonathan Freedland Read more\n\nIn 2011, Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, spent the last weeks of his life negotiating a secret agreement with the US to trade food aid for a suspension of missile testing and uranium enrichment.

They are the anchors of funfair rides, feature in extravagant floral tributes to the country\u2019s \u201cdear\u201d and \u201csupreme\u201d leaders from the Kim dynasty, and appear on stamps, apartment buildings and school walls.\n\nThese celebrations of the country\u2019s weapons programme serve as a constant reminder to residents and visitors of how critical North Korea\u2019s nuclear project has been to its national identity and security.\n\nNorth Korea halts nuclear and missile tests ahead of planned Trump summit Read more\n\nPursued at immense political and financial cost for more than six decades, even through a famine that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, it has proved useful leverage for wringing aid out of world powers, and an increasingly vital security guarantee for a brutal, autocratic regime.\n\nSo the unilateral promise by the leader Kim Jong-un to halt tests of nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and shut down the country\u2019s nuclear test site, was an unexpected commitment that has added to hopes for talks with US and South Korean counterparts.\n\nIt capped months of dramatic diplomacy that have seen Kim and Donald Trump pivot from trading belligerent threats to planning their summit and claiming a shared goal of getting rid of nuclear weapons.\n\nBut experts on North Korea warned that Kim\u2019s statement should be seen more as diplomatic manoeuvring, with relatively limited real costs to Pyongyang, than as a prelude to any genuine moves to gut the prized nuclear programme.\n\nKim is under huge pressure. For the first time in decades North Korea may actually fear an American military attack, and its fragile economy is at huge risk from the strictest sanctions it has ever faced.\n\nEven on a carefully choreographed tour of the capital, long-standing shortages and privations are clear. A handful of cars and buses drift down vast empty streets, solar panels hanging from windows and balconies are testimony to regular power cuts.\n\nKim needs trade to start flowing again, to fill his government coffers and the purses of supporters now grown used to moderate luxuries such as designer handbags, foreign whiskey and taxis to whisk them across town.\n\nHe may be willing to make some genuine concessions for this; an improvement on past talks where Pyongyang has blustered and ultimately offered little more than a return to the status quo. But they will not include America\u2019s stated aim \u2013 the total and irreversible destruction of the nuclear programme. The fate of other dictators who confronted America, but gave up weapons programmes, including Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, has not gone unnoticed.\n\nNorth Korea would be crazy to give up their nuclear deterrent when they have an aggressive nuclear-armed enemy Alex Wellerstein\n\n\u201cPeople like to talk about North Korea as \u2018crazy\u2019. The absolute \u2018craziest\u2019 thing they could do is give up their nuclear deterrent in a situation where they have an aggressive nuclear-armed enemy,\u201d Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science and nuclear weapons and a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology, said. \u201cDoes anyone think they are that crazy? I don\u2019t,\u201d he added.\n\nPyongyang\u2019s aims were still unclear he said, but could include stalling to defuse tensions, seeking recognition from America that it has long felt it deserves, or negotiating to reduce sanctions.\n\nFor now, though, Kim appears focused on making it through the summits. For weeks there have been questions on both sides of the Pacific about whether the meeting with Trump in particular would actually go ahead. It is apparently so sensitive that it has not been reported in North Korean state media. But the CIA chief Mike Pompeo\u2019s visit to Pyongyang, for personal meetings with Kim two weeks ago, appears to have brought a sometimes improbable meeting one step closer to reality.\n\nThe two men appear to have outlined a deal of sorts that would give both sides grounds to claim success even if little real progress is made on removing Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the Wall Street Journal reported. Effectively it would see Kim swap the three Americans in his jails for the prestige of meeting the US president, something North Korean leaders have craved for decades.\n\nThe Americans are academics at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which was founded by a Korean-American Christian, and a businessman charged with spying and stealing state secrets in 2016 \u2013 the 62-year-old was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour.\n\nThat agreement, and Pyongyang\u2019s apparent show of goodwill over weapons testing, appear to make the high-profile summit more likely. But details still have to be hammered out. North Korea has agreed to constraints on its nuclear programme before and then backed away from commitments.\n\nIf Trump strikes a deal with North Korea, I\u2019ll be delighted.

Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne speaks to the media in Adelaide on Friday. Mr Pyne says latest issue in the South China Sea isn't a confrontation. (AAP Video/Tim Dornin)\n\nTHE island fortresses are built. The airfields are ready. The harbours are open.\n\nAll China needs do now is move in the warships and combat jets.\n\nThe chief of US Fleet Forces Command has told US Congress that Beijing has built up enough military infrastructure in the South China Sea to completely control the disputed waterway.\n\n\u201cOnce occupied, China will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania,\u201d Admiral Philip S. Davidson wrote.\n\n\u201cThe PLA will be able to use these bases to challenge US presence in the region, and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants.\n\n\u201cIn short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.\u201d\n\nIt emerged last Thursday that two Australian warships and their supporting tanker were reportedly confronted by the Chinese Navy a week ago as they moved through the region\u2019s vital sea lanes towards a goodwill visit toVietnam.\n\nIn the past, such visits to nations including the Philippines via the South China Sea have been routine.\n\nEXPLORE MORE: Can China\u2019s military stand-up to the US?\n\nWhat has changed is China\u2019s assertion \u2014 flying in the fact of a 2016 international arbitration court ruling \u2014 that it holds national sovereignty over the entire 3.5 million square kilometre waterway. The sea bounds the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nBeijing has established its claim as almost a fait accompli through illegally turning coral reefs and tidal rocky outcrops (the ownership of which is disputed) into enormous fortresses. It says that now these have artificially been turned into islands, they represent sovereign territory.\n\nThe international court of arbitration disagrees.\n\nTREATY TROUBLES\n\nAdmiral Davidson has been nominated to take over the United States\u2019 Pacific Command, responsible for co-ordinating army, navy and air force actions in that region.\n\nHe says only an armed conflict could now stop Beijing from closing the South China Sea\u2019s international sea lanes.\n\nHe told politicians this was why it was vital to recapture the technological advantage US forces held for five decades after World War II.\n\n\u201cIn the future, hypersonic and directed energy weapons, resilient space, cyber and network-capabilities, and well-trained soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and coastguardsmen will be crucial to our ability to fight and win,\u201d he said.\n\nAdmiral Davidson is using the standoff with China to assert the United States\u2019 Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missile limitation agreement (INF Treaty) with Russia is no longer valid.\n\nChina is not a signatory to the treaty. It has been rapidly building up an arsenal of missiles that fall within this category capable of striking US aircraft carrier formations deep at sea.\n\nAdmiral Davidson told Congress his forces cannot defend against new Chinese hypersonic weapons.\n\nDELVE DEEPER: What we know about China's new stealth fighter\n\n\u201cIn the Indo-Pacific, the absence of the INF treaty would provide additional options to counter China\u2019s existing missile capabilities, complicate adversary decision making, and impose costs by forcing adversaries to spend money on expensive missile defence systems,\u201d Admiral Davidson told US Congress.\n\n\u201cI believe the INF treaty today unfairly puts the United States at a disadvantage and places our forces at risk because China is not a signatory.\u201d\n\nFLASHPOINT TAIWAN\n\nChina\u2019s rhetoric over Taiwan has also become increasingly bellicose.\n\nIt\u2019s state-run media has issued a stern warning of \u201cdestruction\u201d if the US continues to develop ties with the last outpost of China to resist Communist rule.\n\n\u201cTaiwan concerns China\u2019s core interests, but Washington has been unbridled in infringing upon the one-China policy and emboldened the small group of separatists in Taiwan to turn more aggressive and arrogant in their secession attempts,\u201d the Global Times editorial reads.\n\n\u201cThe PLA has an unshakeable determination to safeguard national reunification.\n\nWhoever infringes upon the one-China policy and advocates Taiwan independence will invite destruction. And the US is no exception.\u201d\n\nProbing flights by Chinese bombers and fighters have become common place in recent months, with flights regularly circling Taiwan.\n\nFollowing its recent participation in a South China Sea parade, a naval battle-group centered on the aircraft carrier Liaoning has passed between Japan and Taiwan to conduct exercises off its West Pacific shores.\n\n\u201cAlthough peaceful reunification with Taiwan is the optimal choice, in the mainland reunification by force is being seriously considered as an option,\u201d the state-approved editorial reads. \u201cIt is up to Chinese people to eventually decide when and how Taiwan will be reunified.\u201d\n\nIn language reminiscent to that coming from Kim Jong-un\u2019s state controlled North Korean media, the Global Times threatened: \u201cthe more Washington supports Taiwan separatists, the earlier they will see their doomsday coming.\u201d\n\nGROWING ASSERTIVENESS\n\nBeijing political mouthpiece The Global Times has published an article attacking Australia for its \u201chostile sentiment\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf Australia considers exchanges between countries as interference, it should lock itself up in the dark room,\u201d it quotes the Chinese foreign ministry as saying in response to the tense standoff between the two nations\u2019 warships.\n\n\u201cPeople who have such a mindset need to reflect\u201d, foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying reportedly said.\n\n\u201cIf there is no mutual trust, there\u2019s no room for co-operation. China hopes Australia takes practical action and corrects its prejudice against China\u201d.\n\nBut trust is a two-way street.\n\nEarlier this month China reversed its longstanding assertion that it held no intention to militarise the South China Sea artificial islands.\n\nThe claim has always been made in the face of mounting satellite evidence that it had installed hardened bunkers, military weapons systems and sensors, along with military grade runways.\n\nNow, a spokesman from China\u2019s ministry of defence has declared China has a \u201cnatural right as a sovereign nation\u201d to put troops and military equipment in the Spratly Islands.\n\nThe admission came shortly after it was reported military electronic jamming equipment had been installed at Mischief Reef in the Spratleys, alongside its enormous airfield and gun emplacements.\n\nRELATED: Footage reveals China\u2019s South China Sea fortresses\n\nSurveillance photographs published by the Philippines news service The Inquierer earlier this year appeared to show two troop transport ships and an amphibious assault platform docked at Mischief Reef, offloading troops and equipment. Last week, another photograph revealed Chinese air force combat transport aircraft on the island\u2019s tarmac.\n\n\u201cI think, from the very beginning, China, we knew, was militarising the area by reclaiming these areas and by using them as military bases,\u201d said Philippines presidential spokesman Harry Roque.\n\nSTRONG NAVY, SECURE CHINA\n\nAll indications out of Beijing are that stand-offs in what is regarded as the world\u2019s busiest waterway will only increase in size and frequency.\n\nChina\u2019s newly appointed president-for-life Xi Jinping attended a fleet review of more than 40 warships and submarines in the South China Sea on April 12 \u201cshowcasing a new height of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy via its Liaoning carrier battle group and the new-generation nuclear submarine,\u201d the Global Times says. \u201cChina\u2019s ability to defend world and regional peace has reached another milestone.\u201d\n\nIn an address to the assembled sailors, President Xi said the need for a strong navy had never been more urgent.\n\n\u201cThis is crucial to point out in today\u2019s international environment and his tone carried a robust sense of mission,\u201d the news service says. \u201cXi has expressed in several key reports that China is closer than ever to achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. However, history reminds us that the closer we are to accomplishing a glorious goal, the more the pressure and risk.

It would come at a sensitive time for the region\u2019s geopolitics, with negotiations under way on a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nMnuchin\u2019s remarks came as finance ministers and central bankers at the IMF meetings gave their latest economic assessments, often citing trade as a threat looming over the strongest upswing in seven years.\n\nGlobal growth has strengthened and is increasingly broad based, the IMF\u2019s main advisory committee said Saturday. However, it noted that \u201crising financial vulnerabilities, increasing trade and geopolitical tensions, and historically high global debt threaten global growth prospects.\u201d\n\nChina Meeting\n\nIMF First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton summed up the main takeaway he heard from officials at the meetings this week as \u201ctime\u2019s are good but it\u2019s getting risky.\u201d\n\nMnuchin said he met with Yi Gang, governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, at the IMF gathering this week. The discussions focused on issues related to the Chinese central bank, not trade, said the secretary. Mnuchin said they also discussed China\u2019s planned further opening of some markets, a move that U.S. has encouraged and \u201cappreciated.\u201d\n\n\"China will vigorously push forward the reform and opening-up of the financial sector, significantly relax market access restrictions, create a more attractive investment environment, strengthen the protection of intellectual properties and actively expand imports,\" Yi said in a statement on Saturday. China has announced plans to gradually remove foreign ownership caps for limits for car-, ship- and aircraft-makers.\n\nSanctions Help\n\nMnuchin said China has been \u201cvery helpful\u201d in supporting U.S. sanctions against North Korea, and he welcomed Kim\u2019s suspension of nuclear weapons testing that was announced the day earlier.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue the sanctions\u201d and a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign until North Korea abandons its nuclear-weapons program in a verifiable way, he said.\n\nMnuchin indicated he\u2019s involved in a \u201cdialogue\u201d with the Chinese government to resolve the trade dispute. \u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic to see if we can try to reach an agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nTensions have been escalating as Trump accuses China of unfair trade and presses for a reduction in the the U.S.\u2019s $375 billion trade deficit with the Asian nation. The president is threatening to impose tariffs on as much as $150 billion on Chinese imports to punish the nation for alleged intellectual property theft. If the U.S. follows through, China has vowed to impose retaliatory tariffs on everything from American airplanes to soybeans.\n\nRussia, Japan\n\nMnuchin also said he met with Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov during the IMF meeting, at Russia\u2019s request. Moscow sought \u201cclarification\u201d on U.S. sanctions, Mnuchin said, without elaborating. \u201cThese are very important tools. We will continue to look at the use of sanctions in all different areas,\u201d he said.\n\nSiluanov on Friday said he views sanctions as \"an instrument of protectionism\" and condemned any measures taken against his country.\n\nThe U.S. has had discussions with Japan on a possible bilateral trade agreement, the secretary said. Trump had a \u201cvery successful\u201d meeting this week in Florida with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mnuchin said.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said he told Mnuchin that protectionism isn\u2019t good.

I could not have foreseen how scandal after data privacy scandal at Facebook would intensify the discussion.\n\nAt this year\u2019s ever entertaining \u201cinnovation sandbox contest,\u201d a startup competition and hallmark of the conference, a little-known, New York City-based concern called BigID capitalized on the zeitgeist.

In 2014, he livened up a panel I moderated at an enterprise security summit.

Some more stooped now than during the first Bush presidency, mostly grayer, some steadying themselves on canes.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, who always seemed so boyish next to his wife, is in a wheelchair and in frail health at age 93. But still, at a public viewing attended by 6,000 people on the afternoon before the funeral, he sat in front of the flower-laden casket for 20 minutes and greeted the mourners.\n\nIt\u2019s what one does.\n\nAt the funeral, the former president sat in the front row, next to his wife\u2019s casket that was draped in gold and white. Their daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch, better known as \u201cDoro,\u201d sat next to him with her arm around her father\u2019s shoulder, gently stroking his back, turning the pages of his program for him.\n\n\u201cShe was the gold standard of what it meant to be a friend,\u201d said eulogist Susan Garrett Baker, wife of former secretary of state James Baker, who was George H.W. Bush\u2019s White House chief of staff. She listed more of the words that so many used on Saturday: smart, strong, fun, feisty, selfless, compassionate, tender, firm, \u201ca tough but loving enforcer.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump stayed away to \u201cavoid disruptions\u201d caused by presidential security, according to a White House statement. Trump, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, tweeted that his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d were with the Bush family. That came right after a multi-tweet rant about a \u201cthird-rate\u201d reporter, a \u201cdrunk/drugged up loser,\u201d and a \u201cCrooked [Hillary] flunkie.\u201d\n\nTrump finished a round of golf just before the service began and tweeted that he would be watching it on TV. The White House released a statement from Melania Trump calling Bush \u201ca woman of indisputable character and grace\u201d and a \u201cfearless First Lady.\u201d\n\nSitting presidents have often skipped funerals of former first ladies, but Trump\u2019s absence felt more like a presence at times.\n\nJeb Bush, in his eulogy, didn\u2019t mention the president who once called him \u201cdumb as a rock.\u201d But he spoke of how his mother was the \u201cfirst and most important teacher\u201d for her five children. She taught them to \u201csay please and thank you,\u201d he said, and to \u201cbe kind, always tell the truth, never disparage anyone, serve others, treat everyone as you would want to be treated.\u201d\n\nThe mourners and the eulogists were remembering and celebrating not just a woman, but a feeling \u2014 a sense of order, grounding and civility that seems missing today.\n\nA river of bad blood flows between Trump and the Bushes, from Trump\u2019s repeated bashing of Jeb Bush as \u201clow energy\u201d to George H.W. Bush\u2019s dismissal of Trump as a \u201cblowhard.\u201d And an angry Barbara Bush also rose to her son\u2019s defense. She joined Jeb for a CNN interview during the campaign, and said she didn\u2019t understand why anyone would vote for Trump \u2014 especially \u00adwomen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of him,\u201d she said, with a quick flash of anger in her eyes.\n\nIn response, Trump tweeted: \u201cWow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. Not nice!\u201d\n\nWhen Barbara Bush lived in the White House, her husband called for a volunteer force of \u201ca thousand points of light\u201d to make America a \u201ckinder, gentler nation.\u201d Trump tweets about \u201cflunkies\u201d and \u201cslimeballs\u201d and says his behavior is \u201cMODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.\u201d\n\nAt St. Martin\u2019s Church on Saturday, the focus was on a different kind of presidential.\n\nBaker spoke wistfully about how Barbara Bush welcomed her family into the \u201cWashington world\u201d decades ago, hosting events for homeless people at the vice president\u2019s mansion \u201cwhen that wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nMeacham spoke of Bush\u2019s support for victims of HIV and AIDS in the 1980s, and her public hugging of infected children and adults at a time of public ignorance about the disease.\n\n\u201cThe images sent a powerful message \u2014 one of compassion, of love, of acceptance,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke of Bush\u2019s strength after their 3-year-old daughter, Robin, died of leukemia in 1953.\n\nOne guest at the funeral, Rita Hajjar, who co-owns a local pizza restaurant and was dressed in a blue suit, pearls and American flag pin, called Bush \u201cthe best first lady ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe lived in a political era that wasn\u2019t one-sided,\u201d said Hajjar, who named a pizza after Bush, a customer for 25 years. \u201cShe loved everybody.\u201d\n\nThe gathering full of hugs and kisses was a reunion of old friends and colleagues. Former president George W. Bush turned and gave his familiar playful wink to old friends. He and Jeb chatted amiably during the ceremony.\n\nMen and women who have made decisions about war and peace in this country for decades, from former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to Bush aide Brent Scowcroft and former defense secretary Robert Gates, shook hands and sang along with the choir\u2019s soaring \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\n\nAfter the prayers and the blessings ended, eight of Bush\u2019s grandsons slowly wheeled their grandmother\u2019s casket down the main aisle. They were followed by George H.W. Bush in his wheelchair, pushed by his president son.\n\nAs the church filled with the singing of \u201cJoyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee,\u201d mourners stepped out of their pews to catch the hand, or the glance, or any tiny bit of attention from the Bush family. The American dynasty left on the 90-mile journey to the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library for a burial, and for the end of something more than a life.\n\nSullivan reported from Washington."}, {"link": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/384295-pruitt-met-lobbyist-whose-wife-rented-him-condo", "title": "Pruitt met with lobbyist whose wife rented him condo", "text": "Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittDecline in EPA enforcement won't keep climate bill from coming Pruitt once bought Oklahoma home from lobbyist: report Lobbyist whose wife rented to Pruitt sought help from EPA for client MORE met with the lobbyist whose wife rented him a $50-a-night condo in Washington, D.C.\n\nJ.

The momentum swings kept coming as the Wolves responded to the second quarter reality check in the third. Butler had 20 points at the end of the third as Minnesota extended its lead to 87-75. Share\n\nSimmons transforms in history-making show Ben Simmons had the first playoff triple-double by a rookie in nearly 40 years, JJ Redick scored 24 points and the Philadelphia 76ers outlasted the Miami Heat 106-102 to move within a victory of the second round. The 76ers lead the Eastern Conference series 3-1 and can close out the Heat when play resumes in Philadelphia on Tuesday night. Simmons became the first rookie since Magic Johnson in 1980 to post a playoff triple-double \u2014 17 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists. Joel Embiid finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds for Philadelphia. But the Aussie wasn\u2019t getting caught up in the hype. \u201cIt just means I\u2019m doing my job,\u201d he said after the match. \u201cThe stats I\u2019ve averaged all season have been up there. It\u2019s not really anything new for the team or myself.\u201d Teammate JJ Redick has noticed a change in Simmons during the playoffs \u2014 and it\u2019s only a good thing for the Sixers. \u201cHe\u2019s very tough physically, but he\u2019s even tougher mentally,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThe last four games have been as vocal and demonstrative as I\u2019ve seen him all season. He\u2019s been fantastic. \u201cHe\u2019s coming out of his shell in regards to leadership and that\u2019s huge for us.\u201d Dwyane Wade led all scorers with 25 points off the bench for the Heat, who led by 12 points in the second half before letting a game they almost certainly had to have slip away. Wade carried the comeback effort, with the Heat down six and less than two minutes left. His three-point play cut the margin in half and his next two field goals got Miami within one each time. The Heat got no closer. Goran Dragic scored 20, James Johnson had 15 and Hassan Whiteside finished with 13 points and 13 rebounds for Miami, which now needs to pull off some history. The Heat have erased a 3-1 deficit only once, in 1997 against New York. Miami held slim leads at the half \u2014 2-0 in players who went to the locker room injured, 4-0 in stitches received, 61-56 on the scoreboard. A wild scene was the story of the second quarter. Philadelphia\u2019s Dario Saric was driving from the right wing and had his dribble knocked away by Justise Winslow, and four players wound up on the floor as they went for the loose ball. Josh Richardson took the worst of it, getting slammed into by Embiid. Richardson stayed down for more than a minute, eventually getting helped to his feet and to the Miami locker room. Hardly anyone noticed. All eyes were on the other end, where Dragic was shoved to the floor by Robert Covington. James Johnson \u2014 a black belt and MMA fighter \u2014 took exception and went toward Covington, so Simmons came in for a few words. It wound up taking two referees, two Heat coaches and a few players to get everyone separated. Winslow needed stitches to close a gash over his left eye. Richardson, his left shoulder bruised, came back for the second half. Simmons sent another message moments after the dust-up by drilling Wade. Miami led by 12 in the third, but ceded control in a hurry. The Heat went five minutes without scoring, and Redick\u2019s reverse layup with 9:01 left capped a 14-0 run that put Philadelphia up 87-83. The 76ers wouldn\u2019t trail again.

Gesticulating towards the bustling street where the black teenager was murdered 25 years ago today, Clarke says: \u201cA Paki \u2013 an Indian boy \u2013 was stabbed down there just days after Stephen and he never got a plaque. Why is he the only one? What about all the others who\u2019ve died around here and who never got a plaque?\u201d\n\nThe Stephen Lawrence memorial stone, flanked on Friday by fresh bouquets and single flowers, is set into the pavement on Well Hall Road in Eltham, south-east London. After nightfall on 22 April 1993 a gang of five or six white men strutted across the road towards Lawrence shouting: \u201cWhat \u2013 what, nigger?\u201d and plunged a knife into the chest of the 18-year-old aspiring architect.\n\nFor some who live in the neighbouring estate, the death rankles primarily because it compelled British society to change its attitudes to race.\n\n\u201cThey call us white honkys, but if anything happens or you say anything you get called a racist,\u201d says Clarke, clutching a can of energy drink. \u201cSomeone threw white paint on the plaque and a white person got blamed \u2013 but it was a black who did it.\u201d The 48-year-old is standing outside her sister\u2019s home on Scarsbrook Road within Eltham\u2019s Brooks estate, the orderly grid of postwar terracing and semi-detached housing where four of the five men accused of killing Lawrence lived close to each other.\n\nIn 2011 the Old Bailey heard how Lawrence unwittingly provoked the suspects by simply being a black man on their \u201cmanor\u201d. Back then their \u201cmanor\u201d was homogeneous, dominated by members of the white working class, bordered by the unrelenting traffic of Well Hall Road where it becomes part of the South Circular road on the stretch where Lawrence was murdered.\n\nThe estate\u2019s demographic, much like the city stretched out to its north, has changed profoundly since Lawrence\u2019s killers were spotted running into its streets after 10.30pm on a night that has framed the debate on UK race relations since.\n\nNow black and Asian households outnumber the area\u2019s white population, according to residents. One black teenager, asked if he was afraid of walking through the estate at night, says: \u201cNope, it\u2019s more like the other way round \u2013 you\u2019d be scared if you are white.\u201d\n\nJohn Lowman, a retired newsagent, says the estate\u2019s racial profile has changed steadily over the past two and a half decades. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like when they were moving blacks from Walthamstow to Dagenham in the 70s \u2013 then it was: \u2018Blimey, you\u2019ve got a lot of blacks around here\u2019,\u201d the 70-year-old says. \u201cHere it was gradual. People steadily moved in from different cultures. The area is completely changed compared with how it was 25 years ago.\u201d\n\nSeveral doors along from Clarke is Victor, a 52-year-old British Nigerian who pauses from laying a patio in the sunshine to explain that he has never experienced racism in his 10 years on the estate. \u201cIt\u2019s nice around here,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel totally safe.\u201d\n\nOthers feel the same. Trainee filmmaker Nathaniel Callender has been living on the eastern periphery of the estate for 12 months and also never experienced or witnessed any bigotry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely. People are very friendly,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we treat others like equals, if we are open to different cultures, that will inspire people. We are all human,\u201d adds the 23-year-old, standing close to the entrance of Dickson Road, the street down which the Lawrence suspects were seen heading in the moments after the attack.\n\nNearby stands the St Thomas More Catholic primary school. One of its teachers is sitting outside eating lunch. \u201cI wear a headscarf and haven\u2019t encountered much racism around here, although there are pockets,\u201d says Monica (not her real name).\n\nHowever the 40-year-old identifies one variable that she feels has recently toxified sentiment on the estate. \u201cBrexit has had a very negative impact,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s given people the right to say things like: \u2018Go back to your own country.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking above the din of the playground, full of faces that reflect the increasing multiculturalism of the estate, Monica is concerned that attitudes are slipping back to the era when Lawrence was attacked on the pavement 300 metres away.\n\n\u201cFrom my experience it\u2019s like we\u2019re going back to the 1980s when, growing up in Bracknell [Berkshire], we had our door kicked in, eggs thrown at us. These days it\u2019s of a different type, more inadvertent. But social media means more people are involved,\u201d she says.\n\nCharlie Davis, the councillor for Eltham North, who was born the year after the murder, believes the area has an outlook and makeup in keeping with much of the capital. \u201cIt\u2019s like any area in London, very diverse, although probably more green than inner London,\u201d he says.\n\nStatistically the diversity of the Brook estate is reflected in census figures for its ward, Eltham West, which incorporates 3,859 homes holding 10,399 people. Of these 6,839 are classified as white British and 3,560 as black and minority ethnic \u2013 34.2% compared with around 40% for London as a whole.\n\nThe unemployment rate \u2013 poverty is frequently classified as a driver of discrimination \u2013 is slightly higher than the national average, with a third of its working-age population \u2013 2,514 \u2013 economically inactive, higher than the current UK rate of 21.2%.\n\nMeasuring the actual level of hate crime at local level is harder, as the Metropolitan Police only provides data at borough level. For Greenwich, which incorporates the Brook estate, 1,089 religious and race hate crime offences were reported in the two years to February 2018, significantly higher than the 741 offences recorded in Barking and Dagenham to its north, but significantly less than the 1,626 in neighbouring Tower Hamlets.\n\nOther types of crime are a concern on Brook estate. Eltham police station has closed and Clarke, still holding her energy drink, says too few officers patrol the estate.\n\n\u201cIn terms of crime it\u2019s more blacks than whites \u2013 drugs, mainly,\u201d she says. As she speaks, an elderly black resident walks past down Scarsbrook Road. \u201cYou see how it\u2019s changing?\u201d adds Clarke. \u201cThat\u2019s two of them who\u2019ve passed since we been chatting.\u201d\n\nThe man offers a greeting. Clarke turns and shouts: \u201cGood day to you.\u201d"}, {"link": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2771809-brett-brown-shocked-76ers-beat-heat-in-game-4-we-didnt-deserve-to-win", "title": "Brett Brown 'Shocked' 76ers Beat Heat in Game 4: 'We Didn't Deserve to Win'", "text": "Joe Skipper/Associated Press\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Miami Heat 106-102 in Game 4 of the teams' first-round Eastern Conference playoff series Saturday, and head coach Brett Brown was shocked with the result.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the Sixers took a 3-1 series lead, Brown said he was surprised they won.\n\n\"I'm shocked we won this game,\" Brown said, via Josh Friedman of 790 The Ticket. \"We didn't deserve to win this game.\"\n\nIt was an ugly game for the 76ers, who committed 26 turnovers and shot 7-of-31 from three-point range.

Her sister and mother died in the fire too.\n\nLucy\u2019s shocked uncle Ed Lowe, 50, said: \u201cIt\u2019s mindblowing. It\u2019s disgraceful. We always wanted to know why social services didn\u2019t get involved in dealing with Lucy\u2019s abuse. Now we have even more questions.\u201d\n\nLocal MP Lucy Allan, who helped the Sunday Mirror secure an inquiry into child abuse in the town, also told of her dismay.\n\nShe said: \u201cI hope that as part of its work the inquiry will examine the culture of the council. We have seen in other towns, where child sexual exploitation has been prevalent, that the culture of the council led to inaction and silence over many years.\u201d\n\nThe latest revelations will send shockwaves through the Shropshire town, already reeling from the scale of the grooming scandal.\n\nThe 15-year-old victim of perverts Keen and Bould poured out his torment in a childhood diary.\n\nHe said Keen, also a county councillor, was \u201caggressive and a manipulator\u201d.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAfter Bould was convicted, the victim said: \u201cI believed Bould was a friend, probably my best friend at the time, but he did not care about me. I was just an object of lust to him.\u201d\n\nA third politician, local parish councillor Graham White, took indecent images of a 14-year-old girl. He admitted his guilt at the very time Telford was under siege from hordes of paedophiles targeting hundreds of teenagers.\n\nBould and Keen were convicted in 2001 and White faced justice in 2004.\n\nBut it is feared neither Shropshire County Council nor the police carried out an investigation into the men\u2019s conduct \u2013 fuelling fears of an institutional culture of child abuse.\n\nBould was in charge of social services at a time when child sexual exploitation in the town was rife.\n\nCouncil paperwork seen by the Mirror shows that in the late 1990s \u2013 though not specifically saying it was during Bould\u2019s tenure \u2013 social workers became aware of the growing issue but claimed not to \u201cunderstand\u201d the problem.\n\nBould avoided a jail sentence after admitting his guilt.\n\nHe was handed a 12-month community rehabilitation order at Wolverhampton crown court in 2001 for two indecent assaults on the boy, who he first met at a church group.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nHe confessed he\u2019d known the lad was just 15 but had become attracted to him when they shared a sauna following a game of squash.\n\nBould, who had been arrested in October 2000, stood down after 18 years as a councillor.\n\nThis included his stint in the 1990s as chair of Shropshire\u2019s social services, which then covered the Telford area.\n\nThe social services team had become aware of the growing abuse problem but did little to protect vulnerable victims.\n\nTelford and Wrekin Council was formed in 1998.\n\nIt commissioned a report in 2013 which said: \u201cFrom the late 1990s professionals in Telford and Wrekin had concerns about the nature of some of the child sexual abuse cases presented to them.\u201d\n\nBould\u2019s victim believes the councillor and shamed vicar Keen colluded to stop him reporting the assaults to the authorities.\n\nThe boy was abused by the pair in the early 1980s \u2013 coinciding with the earliest reports of child grooming in the town.\n\nKeen, who had previously sat on the police board for the West Mercia force, left Telford soon after.\n\nBut justice would catch up with him years later and in July 2001 he was jailed for 15 months following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.\n\nThe clergyman, ordained in 1973, was found guilty of two indecent assaults.\n\nHe no longer lives in Telford. But Bould continues to play an active part in community life.\n\nUntil recently he served as the clerk of Sheriffhales Parish Council in Shropshire and was photographed three years ago with then Telford MP David Wright.\n\nHe also offers himself as a community organiser and fundraiser.\n\nMeanwhile, his victim has told how he suffered two decades of depression and needed therapy following his ordeal.\n\nReports from Keen\u2019s trial told how the victim broke down in the witness box as he recounted his ordeal at the hands of the two men.\n\nThe man, now in his fifties, later told a local newspaper: \u201cOnce they both realised what was happening, I believe they spoke about keeping it quiet. My feelings towards them both are now a mixture of hate and pity.\u201d\n\nIn 2004 former parish councillor White, 75, pleaded guilty to four counts of taking indecent photographs of a minor.\n\nHe was given a three year rehabilitation order by Shropshire magistrates and ordered to take part in a sex offenders programme.\n\nThe court was told White had been a councillor in Madeley near Telford but had resigned the previous month.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nHis name was ordered to stay on the Sex Offenders Register for just five years.\n\nThe revelations come just a week after authorities in the town were forced into a U-turn and voted to commission an independent inquiry into child grooming.\n\nWe revealed how children were exploited by sex gangs over four decades as police and social services failed to act.\n\nWhen approached by the Sunday Mirror, Bould said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment.\u201d\n\nKeen and White were unavailable for comment.\n\nA West Mercia police spokeswoman said of Keen: \u201cPrior to 1997, the jurisdiction for police \u00adauthorities fell to local councils.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any questions around the conduct about a member would need to be directed to the appropriate local council as any archive would be held by them and not police.\u201d\n\nShropshire Council was checking whether a probe was carried out into Bould\u2019s time in charge of social services.\n\nBut it did not respond with evidence of an inquiry at the time of going to press.\n\nCover-up fears after latest shockwave hits Telford\n\nToday's revelations will trigger fresh fears of an establishment cover-up to protect high-powered individuals and the reputation of local authorities.\n\nIn a string of exclusives the Sunday Mirror established:\n\nTwo whistleblowers were punished after speaking out about child sexual exploitation.\n\nPolice chaplain Keith Osmund-Smith was suspended after\n\nhe passed over files on ongoing abuse.\n\nhe passed over files on ongoing abuse. Then a concerned employee was forced to resign from a post with a local counselling service after speaking out.\n\nVictims of grooming and their families claimed they were told not to talk to our investigators or to contribute to our probe.\n\nWest Mercia\u2019s Police and Crime Commissioner John Campion emailed the Home Office to say he didn\u2019t believe a specific Telford inquiry was necessary \u2013 after publicly suggesting he would support one.\n\nCampaigning MP Lucy Allan was told she could not address a crucial council meeting which was considering whether to hold a formal inquiry into child explotation. But the council relented after a public backlash, Ms Allan was allowed to speak at the meeting nine days ago \u2013 and the authority voted unanimously to hold an investigation.\n\nInquiry will be independent, vows council\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nThe chair of an inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Telford will be chosen by an independent body to be formed next week.\n\nLabour councillor Lee Carter, who will act as liaison between Telford and Wrekin Council and the investigation, said the council has ringfenced \u00a3350,000 to pay for the inquiry.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis independent organisation will work with victims, survivors and others to set the terms of reference for an inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe move comes 18 months after Tory MP Lucy Allan first called for an inquiry following revelations in the Sunday Mirror.\n\nCouncillors finally agreed to hold a probe at a meeting nine days ago.

He was convicted by an all-white jury. Johnson spent seven years abroad as a fugitive before returning to the United States and turning himself in. He served about a year in federal prison.\n\nSylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2018\n\nCongressional leaders have sought a pardon for Johnson for years. A bill requesting a pardon from George W. Bush passed the House of Representatives in 2008 but died in the Senate.\n\nA 1,000-page education bill in 2015 included a provision requesting a pardon for Johnson. It called the boxer a \u201cflamboyant, defiant, and controversial figure in the history of the United States who challenged racial biases.\u201d\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former senator Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), along with Congressmen Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.), requested a pardon from President Obama in 2016.\n\nJohn Arthur \u201cJack\u201d Johnson, nicknamed the \u201cGalveston Giant\u201d in the ring, was born in 1878 southeast of Houston. By 1903, he became the unofficial \u201cNegro heavyweight champion.\u201d World heavyweight champion Jim Jeffries refused to fight him and instead retired. But in 1910, Johnson gained the championship belt, and Jeffries emerged from retirement to \u201creclaim the heavyweight championship for the white race.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff, it\u2019s up to you,\u201d novelist Jack London wrote before the bout, according to NPR. \u201cThe White Man must be rescued.\u201d\n\nInstead, Johnson pummeled Jeffries for 15 rounds in \u201cthe battle of the century\u201d and won the belt outright.\n\n\u201cI could never have whipped Johnson at my best,\u201d Jeffries later said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have hit him. No, I couldn\u2019t have reached him in 1,000 years.\u201d\n\nThe Mann Act was signed just weeks prior, though, and federal investigators almost immediately began looking into Johnson\u2019s romantic life.\n\nHe married a white woman, Etta Terry Duryea, in 1911, but their relationship was rocky and she committed suicide a year later. Three months after that, he married Lucille Cameron, who was also white. Her mother was so disgusted with the relationship, she claimed Cameron had been kidnapped, but Cameron refused to cooperate with investigators.\n\nBut law enforcement agents found Belle Schreiber, a Chicago prostitute with whom Johnson had an affair years earlier. She agreed to testify against the boxer in 1913, and an all-white jury took less than two hours to convict him. He skipped bail after the trial and traveled Europe and South America with Cameron before surrendering to American agents at the Mexican border in 1920.\n\nHe served a one-year prison term in Leavenworth, Kan., and returned to find that society and the ring that wouldn\u2019t accept him.\n\nBefore his incarceration, Johnson was known to prance around the ring with swagger. He owned a nightclub and wore gold teeth. He once reportedly purchased a pet leopard and took it for walks while sipping champagne.\n\nBut by 1921, he was past his prime, and boxing instituted a stricter color barrier. It would be another 16 years until Joe Louis defeated James Braddock in Chicago to win the world heavyweight title.\n\nHe fought, often for private audiences as celebrity appearances, until age 67 in 1945. He died a year later in a car wreck in North Carolina, speeding from a restaurant that refused him service.\n\nMore from The Post:\n\nBrewer: Wizards channel their instinct for conflict to get back into series with Raptors\n\nWhile Shaquem Griffin took on football with one hand, his twin brother always had his back\n\nThe top 50 prospects for the NFL draft and the key questions they face"}, {"link": "https://www.nextbigfuture.com/tag/china", "title": "china", "text": "China is \u201csputniking\u201d the USA with military technology surprises.

I could never forgive him for what he did, but I did think he might do the right thing and say what he did and how he feels about his terrible crime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last four years trying to get my head around being his daughter. I\u2019ve never done anything wrong in my life, but he\u2019s cast a huge shadow over it.\n\n\u201cMy mum warned me against contacting him and said he\u2019d be too much of a coward to give me a straight answer.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cI thought perhaps he would do something decent now he\u2019s had 15 years in prison to think about what he\u2019s done. But she was right. I was naive.\n\n\u201cHe said he wants me to meet him one day, but I\u2019ll never, ever agree to see him now.\u201d\n\nFriends Holly and Jessica, both 10, were murdered by Huntley at his house in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in August 2002. They were pupils at the school near where he worked as a caretaker.\n\nThe girls went missing after leaving a family barbecue to buy sweets. Their bodies were found two weeks later.\n\nHuntley, 44, denied their murder and has never given a full account of what happened.\n\nSamantha \u2013 who lives in Cleethorpes, Lincs, just three miles from her father\u2019s home town Grimsby \u2013 started writing to him in autumn.\n\n(Image: picture collect)\n\n\u201cBeing his daughter haunts you and there\u2019s no escape. I\u2019ve grown up here with people whispering, \u2018that\u2019s Ian Huntley\u2019s daughter\u2019. One boyfriend dumped me as soon as he found out,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve often burst into tears when his face has appeared on the TV screen. My mother was a victim of Huntley as he inflicted violence on her when she was just 15 and he was her boyfriend. He attacked her when she was expecting me. She\u2019s told me I was very nearly his first victim when I was still in her womb. Because she was pregnant with me she found the strength to break free, but she saw his dark side.\n\n\u201cShe sheltered me in childhood, and I only found out when we were doing crime rates for Grimsby and Cleethorpes and the picture of my mum came up on Google. It took me straight to the story that he was my dad.\n\n\u201cI was utterly devastated then. And now I\u2019m older I thought that by writing to him I could put that to rest and get answers as to why he did what he did to those two innocent little girls.\n\n(Image: picture collect)\n\n\u201cI hoped it would enable me to move forward with my life. But that\u2019s not what he said.\u201d Instead Huntley told Samantha he didn\u2019t \u201crelish\u201d the idea of discussing what was \u201cunimaginably the most horrendous day of my life\u201d.\n\nAlso he claimed he didn\u2019t understand what happened.\n\nThe only admission Samantha got from lifer Huntley in letters back from maximum security Frankland prison in Durham was that he had failed her as a father.\n\nBut even then he claimed he has never forgotten Samantha\u2019s birthday.\n\nWhile his troubled daughter wanted answers as to why her father was a child killer, he concentrated instead on bragging about how he spends his day project managing a team of painters and decorators behind bars. The murderer said he had been painting for the last five years. Giving an insight into life inside prison, he said there was only one \u201cfriend\u201d on his wing of 108 inmates who he felt he could trust.\n\nHuntley also expressed his desire for Samantha to meet members of his family, including his mother Lynda. The murderer, serving two life terms for his crime, even joked about his family recounting embarrassing stories about his childhood, apparently oblivious to the distress he has caused his daughter.\n\n(Image: MMP Cambridge)\n\nAnd in one pathetic attempt to win her over, Huntley claimed he had always been interested in her life.\n\nFinally, he shut Samantha out \u2013 recently telling her he was not going to respond to her for the \u201cforseeable\u201d, telling her that his letters would be read by security. \u201cI felt he had a fear of someone making money. That saddens me even more,\u201d says Samantha. \u201cI do think about Holly and Jessica\u2019s families, and the agony he put them through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry he was ever born, but at the same time if he hadn\u2019t been then I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\n\n\u201cOf course a part of me is fascinated and yet I also feel intense revulsion as he has a blood connection to me I wish did not exist. But the reality is that it does exist. There is this blood connection and I\u2019m trying to come to terms with that. I know there isn\u2019t any evilness in me.\n\n(Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cReading his letters made me realise that he enjoys a life behind bars, but he stole the life of those two little girls and in doing so he stole their families\u2019 future too.\n\n\u201cI know now he\u2019s never going to give me the answers that I\u2019m looking for. And while that makes me sad, at the same time, it\u2019s also allowed me to close the door on him.I just can\u2019t allow him to impact on my life any more.\u201d\n\nNEXT WEEK: Huntley\u2019s ex...\u2018My hell at hands of monster\u2019"}, {"link": "http://www.theladbible.com/news/film-and-tv-news-tributes-pour-in-following-the-death-of-verne-troyer-at-49-20180421", "title": "Tributes Pour In Following The Death Of Verne Troyer At 49", "text": "Mike Myers has paid tribute to actor Verne Troyer following the announcement of his death.\n\nMyers, who starred alongside Troyer in the Austin Powers' movies and The Love Guru, said: \"Verne was the consummate professional and a beacon of positivity for those of us who had the honour of working with him.\n\n\"It is a sad day, but I hope he is in a better place.

President Donald Trump says he's considering \"a Full Pardon!\" for boxing's first black heavyweight champion more than 100 years after Jack Johnson was convicted by all-white jury of \"immorality\" for one of his relationships. AP file\n\nMost famously, his story was fictionalized for the play \"The Great White Hope,\" starring James Earl Jones, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the Tony Award for best play in 1969. A film version with Jones was released in 1970. More recently, the documentary \"Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,\" directed by Ken Burns, was aired on PBS in 2004.\n\nJohnson was convicted in 1913 for violating the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport women across state lines for \"immoral\" purposes.\n\nThe boxer died in 1946. His great-great niece has pressed Trump for a posthumous pardon, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have been pushing Johnson's case for years.\n\nThe tweet came a week after Trump pardoned I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, who had been a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, arguing that Libby had been \"treated unfairly\" by a special counsel.\n\nStallone, who starred in the 1976 boxing film \"Rocky\" and several sequels, is a supporter of the president and attended Trump's New Years' Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in 2016.\n\nMcCain previously told The Associated Press that Johnson \"was a boxing legend and pioneer whose career and reputation were ruined by a racially charged conviction more than a century ago.\"\n\n\"Johnson's imprisonment forced him into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice, and continues to stand as a stain on our national honor,\" McCain said earlier this month.\n\nIn Jim Crow America, Johnson was one of the most despised African-American of his generation, humiliating white fighters and flaunting his affection for white women.\n\nThe son of former slaves, he defeated Tommy Burns for the heavyweight title in 1908 at a time when blacks and whites rarely entered the same ring. He then mowed down a series of \"great white hopes,\" culminating in 1910 with the undefeated former champion, James J. Jeffries.\n\n\"He is one of the craftiest, cunningest boxers that ever stepped into the ring,\" said the legendary boxer John L. Sullivan, in the aftermath of what was called \"the fight of the century.\"\n\nBut Johnson also refused to adhere to societal norms, living lavishly and brazenly and dating outside of his race in a time when whites often killed African-Americans without fear of legal repercussions.\n\nAfter seven years as a fugitive following his conviction, Johnson eventually returned to the U.S. and turned himself in. He served about a year in federal prison and was released in 1921. He died in 1946 in an auto crash.\n\nThe stain on Johnson's reputation forced some family members to live in shame of his legacy.\n\nThe family \"didn't talk about it because they were ashamed of him, that he went to prison,\" Linda E. Haywood, 61, has said of her great-great uncle. \"They were led to believe that he did something wrong. They were so ashamed after being so proud of him.\"\n\nHaywood said she didn't find out she was related to Johnson until she was 12. She remembers learning about Johnson when she was in sixth grade during Black History Month, and only learned later that he was kin.\n\nOnce, she recalled, she asked her mother about Johnson.\n\n\"She just grimaced,\" Haywood said.\n\nHaywood has pressed to have Johnson pardoned since President George W. Bush was in office, a decade ago.\n\nPosthumous pardons are rare, but not unprecedented. President Bill Clinton pardoned Henry O. Flipper, the first African-American officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry Regiment during the Civil War; he was framed for embezzlement. Bush pardoned Charles Winters in 2008, an American volunteer in the Arab-Israeli War convicted of violating the U.S. Neutrality Acts in 1949.\n\nHaywood wanted Barack Obama, the nation's first black president, to pardon Johnson, but Justice Department policy says \"processing posthumous pardon petitions is grounded in the belief that the time of the officials involved in the clemency process is better spent on the pardon and commutation requests of living persons.\"\n\nThe Justice Department makes decisions on potential pardons through an application process and typically makes recommendations to the president. The general DOJ policy is to not accept applications for posthumous pardons for federal convictions, according to the department's website.\n\nBut Trump has shown a willingness to work around the DOJ process."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43845692", "title": "Sevilla 0-5 Barcelona", "text": "Sevilla have not beaten Barcelona in the last nine attempts\n\nLuis Suarez scored two goals as Barcelona produced a masterclass to beat Sevilla and win the Copa del Rey final for the fourth successive season.\n\nSevilla were 3-0 down at half-time, Suarez tapping home Philippe Coutinho's pass to open the scoring in Madrid.\n\nLionel Messi doubled the lead before setting up Suarez for the third.\n\nAndres Iniesta added the fourth before Coutinho's penalty sealed Barca's first trophy since Ernesto Valverde took charge last May.\n\nSevilla, who had beaten Atletico Madrid on their way to the final, were completely outplayed in Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano.\n\nAt 1-0, Joaquin Correa missed a good chance from 10 yards out while Sandro Ramirez fired straight at keeper Jasper Cillessen after racing clear.\n\nHowever, chances were few and far between as Barca eased to victory.\n\nEuropean also-rans but untouchable in Spain\n\nThis victory helped ease the pain of losing to Roma in the Champions League in astonishing circumstances.\n\nBarca conceded a 4-1 first leg quarter-final lead as they lost the second leg 3-0 in Italy.\n\nYet there was never any doubt they would blow this game once Suarez made it 1-0 from inside the six-yard area.\n\nValverde's side turned on the style on the way to the club's 30th Copa del Rey triumph.\n\nIniesta hit the bar before Jordi Alba's sublime backheel allowed Messi to add the second, the Argentine's 40th goal for Barca this season.\n\nSuarez produced a composed low finish to make it 3-0 before the interval.\n\nBarcelona captain Andres Iniesta is to make an announcement on his future after being strongly linked with a move to China\n\nBarca refused to ease off in the second half, Iniesta finishing off another sublime move for the fourth goal after rounding keeper David Soria.\n\nCoutinho completed the rout from the penalty spot after defender Clement Lenglet had handled inside his area.\n\nBarcelona could complete the domestic double on Sunday if second-placed Atletico Madrid lose to Real Betis (19:45 BST).\n\nMeanwhile, Sevilla have not won since knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League on 13 March.\n\nMan of the match - Andres Iniesta (Barcelona)"}, {"link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/life-2ft-8in-sex-obsessed-369117", "title": "'My life with 2ft 8in Austin Powers star Verne Troyer'", "text": "Get celebs updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

But by the time he got home to Los Angeles he claimed he had lost it. We spent ages searching through his bags.\n\n\u201cI realised he was lying when I suggested we phone the diamond store and he refused. In the end he got me a pair of Puma trainers \u2013 but I later found out he got them as a freebie.\u201d\n\nVerne tried to make up for the non-existent diamond ring the following month by buying Ranae a \u201cdiamond\u201d necklace.\n\nShe said: \u201cAfter we broke up I took it to a pawn shop. The man there bit into it and left teeth marks. It was so embarrassing. The man said it was the type of necklace someone would get out of an arcade machine.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nRanae says she initially felt no attraction for Verne, and when he asked for her number at the party she gave it to him \u201cas a joke\u201d. But he called at 10am the next day and she agreed to meet him out of curiosity.\n\nShe said: \u201cOur first date was at his house. We just watched American Idol and played video games. Back then Verne was living in a guesthouse at the back of his manager\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cIt was a specially designed for him, with a miniature futon and miniature bathroom and so on, with the lights all on a lower level so he could reach them. But I wasn\u2019t freaked out. I\u2019m an odd person myself and not a lot weirds me out. I don\u2019t date normal people!\n\n\u201cI started going to his house every evening and before long I started falling for him. We had our first kiss after the first few dates. We were lying on the bed and I just leaned over and kissed him. Verne is a good kisser and he seemed like a pretty cool guy \u2013 and that was the attraction. But first impressions can be deceptive.\u201d\n\nRanae says she held out for a month before sleeping with Verne \u2013 then decided she would only to test her true feelings for him. But their first night together was anything but romantic.\n\nRanae said: \u201cTo be honest, most of the night was horrible. I closed my eyes and thought \u2018charity work\u2019, meaning I was doing it for him and not me.\u201d\n\nRanae claims their sex life never got any better \u2013 much to the frustration of Verne, who suffers from dwarfism.\n\n\u201cIn the time we were together we made love only six times as I would always find excuses for why I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVerne would get mad and tell me that if we were not having sex we could never be anything more than friends.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be his girlfriend, but I never enjoyed the sexual part of our relationship.\u201d\n\nDespite their problems, in March the couple decided to rent an apartment.Verne claimed he had \u201ccashflow problems\u201d, so Ranae volunteered to pay half of the \u00a31,100-a-month rent, thinking he would be too gallant to accept. But he did, without hesitation.\n\nRanae said: \u201cVerne was a nightmare to live with. He refused to do anything for himself and would order me around like a slave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that he couldn\u2019t take care of himself, because he is perfectly fine now I am gone.\n\n\u201cBut I think he used my niceness against me \u2013 he knew I wouldn\u2019t complain.\n\n\u201cAnd I think having someone wait on him made him feel like more of a celebrity.\n\n\u201cIn the morning I would have to lay out all his fan mail in an assembly line. He would make me read them to him. Then he would sign a picture of himself and put it in an envelope to be sent back to the fan. I would then have to take all these letters to the post office .\n\n\u201cI was like his assistant but he never paid me. Before I left the house I would have to open the top of every drink bottle as Verne\u2019s wrists are too weak.\n\n\u201cAfter that I would buy his groceries and carry them home and cook dinner, although most days all Verne would eat would be a blueberry muffin and then he\u2019d be full. And not once did I get a thank-you.\u201d\n\nVerne has had a long battle with alcoholism \u2013 at one point knocking back a bottle of spirits and a six-pack of beer in a day despite his tiny frame, according to reports.\n\nBut Ranae says that she was able to get him to cut back. \u201cHe would only drink excessively when he was with other people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOnce I went to a karaoke bar with him and his manager and in two hours he had knocked back four beers and four tequilas, which for a man his size is very dangerous.\n\n\u201cAnd Verne is horrible when he drinks \u2013 mean and aggressive. Sometimes when he was away he would call me up in the middle of the night crying like a baby because he felt guilty he had been drinking.\n\n\u201cI caught him cheating numerous times when we were together. Sometimes I found out by looking at his phone and seeing text messages he had sent to other girls.\u201d\n\nBut Ranae said she would have been able to forgive Verne\u2019s bad behaviour if he had been more romantic.\n\nShe said: \u201cVerne never wanted to go out as he hates people staring at him because of his size.\n\n\u201cMost of the time he sat at home playing video games or googling himself. He loved reading about himself or watching himself on TV \u2013 he\u2019s obsessed with his celebrity.\n\n\u201cWhen we did go out it was normally to Taco Bell or McDonald\u2019s. There were only about three times he took me to nice restaurants and then it was embarrassing because the waitress would have to stack phone books on his seat so he could get to the level of the table.\u201d\n\nThe couple split after their raunchy video was made public and Ranae says there is no prospect of a reconciliation. She said: \u201cBeing with him was horrible. It was like being with a child.\u201d\n\nBut she thinks the Mini Me actor will show a full-size ego in the BB house. Ranae says: \u201cVerne once told me he would never go on Celebrity Big Brother as it is for has-beens and he is a real actor.\n\n\u201cHe will be thinking everyone around him is a has-been and he is like Brad Pitt.\n\n\u201cIt would be great TV if they put me in there... sparks would definitely be flying.\u201d\n\nnews@sundaymirror.co.uk\n\n- This story was first published in 2009"}, {"link": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/21/facebook-given-week-protect-children/", "title": "Facebook given a week to protect children", "text": "Ministers are considering laws to punish social media firms that allow flagrant breaches of age limits as they accuse companies such as Facebook of \u201cturning a blind eye to a generation of children being exposed to harm\u201d.\n\nThe chief medical officer is to review the impact of technology on children\u2019s mental health, in an attempt to recommend daily \u201chealthy screen time\u201d limits.\n\nThe firms have been given one week to explain what actions they have taken to cut underage use, stop cyber bullying and encourage healthy screen time, and what more they intend to do.\n\nIn an extraordinary letter, Jeremy Hunt said the failure of the firms to prevent young children using social media was \u201cunacceptable and irresponsible,\u201d..."}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/43838176", "title": "Amir Khan knocks out Phil lo Greco in 40 seconds", "text": "Khan had Lo Greco on the canvas after only 13 seconds\n\nAmir Khan's return to the ring lasted less than a minute as the Briton knocked out Phil lo Greco in only 40 seconds in Liverpool.\n\nKhan, fighting for the first time in two years, first dropped Canada's Lo Greco after just 13 seconds with a blazing left-right combination.\n\nAnd he delivered the coup de grace with a flurry of thunderous body shots soon after.\n\n\"I was a little nervous, but I am back with a big bang,\" Khan, 31, said.\n\n\"I want to become a world champion this year or next year.\"\n\nFormer light-welterweight world champion Khan had not fought since his knockout defeat by Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas in 2016, while his previous bout in Britain ended in a points victory over Julio Diaz in Sheffield five years ago.\n\n\"I have been out the ring for two years but I was still in the gym working hard, I have never taken a day off.

He even vied to be Trump\u2019s original secretary of State, but was passed over for the job.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that is surprising about this to anyone in the president\u2019s orbit is that it took this long for Rudy to join Trump\u2019s team in an official capacity,\u201d said a former administration official.\n\nPeople in Trump World believe Giuliani will be able to tell Trump \u201cno\u201d while also remaining in his good graces because of their personal relationship.\n\nBut some fear Giuliani has been out of the game too long \u2014 he has not practiced law full-time in decades \u2014 to strike fear into Mueller\u2019s team of seasoned attorneys.\n\nGiuliani is an attack dog\n\nThere\u2019s another side to Giuliani that Trump likes \u2014 he is not afraid of a fight.\n\nThe 73-year-old was one of Trump\u2019s most vocal surrogates during the 2016 presidential race, tearing into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGeorge HW Bush wears 'book socks' to Barbara Bush's funeral to honor her passion for literacy Obamas, Clintons to attend funeral of Barbara Bush Hillary Clinton to fundraise in DC for public charter high school MORE at campaign rally after campaign rally.\n\nHe made a string of controversial statements, including a false claim that Clinton did not go to the World Trade Center site after the Sept. 11 attacks. Those comments drew criticism but endeared him to Trump.\n\nExpect Giuliani to appear on cable news shows to defend the president, and possibly attack the probe into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nOne of his past statements could be a problem\n\nNow that he has officially joined Trump\u2019s legal team, one of Giuliani\u2019s campaign-trail jabs may come back to haunt him.\n\nThe ex-mayor hinted during an Oct. 26, 2016, Fox News interview that he has insider knowledge about the federal probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server as secretary of State.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about some pretty big surprises,\u201d he said.\n\nThen-FBI Director Comey announced two days later the bureau had resumed its investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s comments sparked speculation that he had been tipped off by the FBI, something he denied.\n\nBut the comments worried top brass at the FBI, which launched an investigation at Comey\u2019s direction into whether Giuliani\u2019s comments were the result of a leak.\n\n\u201cI got fired before it was finished, but I know that I asked that it be investigated,\u201d Comey told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow this week.\n\nIf Giuliani remains under suspicion, that could complicate his interactions with federal authorities as Trump\u2019s lawyer.\n\nAttorney General Giuliani?

Some Republicans are talking about it MORE as attorney general.\n\nTrump during the transition reportedly offered the job to Giuliani, who turned it down in hopes of being named secretary of State.\n\nSessions has never escaped Trump\u2019s doghouse over his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe and the president reportedly mused last summer about giving the job to Giuliani.\n\nBut such a move is doubtful, in large part because the former mayor could struggle to win a confirmation vote in the Senate.\n\nGiuliani would face tough scrutiny over the paid speeches he gave while in the private sector and his views on abortion have never gelled with socially conservative Republicans."}, {"link": "https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/what-is-empathy/", "title": "What is empathy? | Are we really hard-wired to feel other people\u2019s pain?", "text": "By continuing to use the site, you agree to the use of cookies.

The property began life in the early 1990s as a series of stories and novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, focused on the fantasy-world adventures of mercenary monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia. The books were later adapted into video games that were major commercial and critical successes.\n\nThough association with a video game might make some scoff, Geralt\u2019s story invites comparison to some of the hottest properties in episodic television. Most obviously, it features the combination of spectacular fantasy, gritty politics, and unapologetic sex that have made Game of Thrones a sensation. The franchise also often delves into complex morality, personal relationships, and social issues, paving the way for the sophistication of Mad Men or The Sopranos.\n\nThe series was announced in May, but major new details came yesterday from veteran TV writer Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, hired as showrunner and executive producer in February. In addition to the show\u2019s planned debut schedule and length of the first season (there are almost certain to be more), Hissrich revealed on Twitter that the series will be shooting in Eastern Europe, writing that \u201cthis show couldn\u2019t exist anywhere else.\u201d Though the series will reportedly be based on the original novels, The Witcher\u2019s game incarnations are deeply influenced by Slavic mythology and, arguably, a dour Eastern European temperament.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\n\nThat backdrop does present a potential problem for the Netflix series. Though critics hailed the most recent Witcher game for its rich atmosphere, they also pointed out that it did not feature a single non-white character. While the game\u2019s developers defended that as reflective of its Polish roots, repeating the lack of diversity in a high-profile, American-backed TV series would spell almost certain doom. Hissrich said that casting for the series is still in progress.\n\nNetflix has continued to invest massive sums on shows and movies, including a planned $8 billion in 2018. That puts it on par with the non-sports spending of established giants like Time Warner, Fox, and Disney. The spending has helped drive spectacular subscriber growth and a market value currently north of $140 billion."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxsports.com%2Fnascar%2Fvideo%2F1216355907824%3Futm_campaign%3Dshare_buttons%26utm_medium%3Dfscom%26utm_content%3Dreturn_visit%26utm_term%3Dhomepage%26utm_source%3Dshare_fb", "title": "", "text": "Email address or phone number: Password: Forgotten account?\n\nLog into your Facebook account to share."}, {"link": "http://us.cnn.com/2018/04/21/entertainment/verne-troyer-obit/index.html", "title": "Verne Troyer, 'Mini-Me' in Austin Powers films, dies at 49", "text": "(CNN) Verne Troyer, who played Mini-Me in two of the Austin Powers comedy films, has died at the age of 49, according to statements posted to his social media accounts Saturday.\n\nTroyer was 49.

Some twitter accounts, especially those visibly supportive of Saudi rival Qatar, suggested a coup attempt was unfolding, while others dismissed this, saying they believed a drone had flown too close to the palace, prompting security forces to open fire and down it.\n\n\"Ongoing violence in the capital Riyadh and The_Fleeing_of_King_Salman raises concern #Gunfire_in_Al-Khuzami-neighborhood,\" Masarir tweeted alongside a video of what appeared to be scenes of unrest.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\"With the ongoing violence in the capital Riyadh #Gunfire_in_Al-Khuzama-neighborhood and with #The_fleeing_of_King_Salman I hope that no citizens are hurt,\" he added.\n\nAccording to an unnamed senior Saudi official cited by Reuters, however, King Salman was not at the palace but \"at his farm in Al-Diriyah.\" The town, located in the northwestern outskirts of Riyadh, was the original home of the centuries-old Al Saudi family that leads the kingdom.\n\nSaudi Arabia is ruled by a conservative Sunni Muslim monarchy headed by King Salman.

She\u2019s bold, opinionated and fearless. In two minutes, she gave a gutsier and more authentic moment than anything we\u2019ve seen all year on any breakfast television show.\n\nThe 44-year-old\u2019s lashing on Sunday night was gobsmacking in the best possible way. While her co-host Basil Zempilas described the lacklustre and heavily panned Closing Ceremony as \u201cdisappointing\u201d, it was Griggs who kicked it up into gear and began tearing it apart.\n\nJO FIRES UP: James Weir recaps the Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re being way too polite,\u201d a visibly enraged Griggs said live on-air before going on to criticise the decision not to show athletes entering the stadium. \u201cI\u2019m furious.\u201d\n\nIn a final blistering example of the failure, she told viewers: \u201cThere\u2019s no athletes in here. I\u2019ve never seen the stadium so empty. It\u2019s so wrong, Baz.\u201d\n\nGriggs\u2019 comments came as a surprise. As host of lifestyle shows Better Homes & Gardens and House Rules and as the steady hand guiding a lot of Channel Seven\u2019s sport coverage, she\u2019s the last person anyone expects to rock the boat. And it\u2019s because of this that her decision to articulate what many Australians were thinking had such cut-through. The ripples Griggs \u2014 who began her broadcast career at Seven in 1993 after retiring as a champion swimmer \u2014 created indicate something bigger: We want more.\n\nThe moment also served as a reminder.\n\nIt takes a moment like this for a network to realise the value they\u2019re sitting on. Channel 9 experienced it last year after Tracy Grimshaw quietly and expertly eviscerated Don Burke in her interview following sexual harassment allegations. It seemed viewers and network bosses were reminded \u2014 and almost shocked \u2014 that the veteran presenter could do such an impeccable job. A job she\u2019s been doing for more than three decades.\n\n\u201cI think the obvious thing for me is after seeing a devastating interview [Burke\u2019s] at the end of last year is to have more Tracy in the program,\u201d A Current Affair\u2019s new executive producer Steve Burling told The Australian in February.\n\nGiven the traction Griggs\u2019 comments received in the days that followed the Closing Ceremony, it would be perplexing if Seven bosses weren\u2019t thinking of how to extract the searing, intelligent candour of their family-friendly host and inject it around the network.\n\nFor hosts like Grimshaw and Griggs, their skills aren\u2019t newly acquired. With the restraints of network television \u2014 and in the boundaries of what programmers think audiences want \u2014 they\u2019re not given the opportunities to expand and get messy like their male counterparts. They\u2019re not concerned with using their personal lives to grab headlines and they\u2019re also not seen as typical, out-of-the-box prime time commercial talent. With Nine\u2019s recent push \u2014 following the Burke interview \u2014 to nab Grimshaw the Gold Logie at this year\u2019s awards, perhaps it\u2019s a sign television networks are beginning to sit up and hear the message.\n\nFor Griggs, her edge has always simmered beneath the surface. She gave a taste of it when \u2014 accepting the Logie for Better Homes & Gardens in 2011 \u2014 she took aim at Karl Stefanovic for declaring his then-wife Cassandra Thorburn had the \u201cbest arse\u201d.\n\n\u201cKarl, we don\u2019t have bum and boobs jokes \u2014 it\u2019s just nice family viewing,\u201d she said sharply in her own speech.\n\nAnd on Sunday night, Griggs again decided to show this edge. She was both applauded and criticised for her comments. Making her takedown even more refreshing was seeing her stand by her words in the days that followed. She publicly railed against those who didn\u2019t agree \u2014 including fellow personalities and industry figures.\n\nIn a TV world with too many commentators without a single opinion, Griggs showed us she has a lot to say and isn\u2019t afraid of the trouble. It would be a shame if Seven don\u2019t let her give us more of this.\n\n@hellojamesweir"}, {"link": "http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/21/austin-powers-actor-verne-troyer-dies-aged-49-7486696/", "title": "Austin Powers actor Verne Troyer dies aged 49", "text": "Actor Verne Troyer has died (Picture: Getty)\n\nActor Verne Troyer has died at the age of 49 according to his Facebook and Instagram.\n\nHe was best known for playing Mini Me in the Austin Powers comedies.\n\nA tribute on his social media reads: \u2018It is with great sadness and incredibly heavy hearts to write that Verne passed away today.\n\n\u2018Verne was an extremely caring individual.

The Vanguard Action Squad assembles. The Vanguard Action Squad assembles.\n\nWarning: Full spoilers for the episode below.\n\nInstead of jumping right into the next major conflict, Season 3 of My Hero Academia has taken its time to lay the groundwork for UA High's next showdown with the League of Villains. \"Kota\" puts the final pieces into place, delivering a well written episode that does an excellent job at further developing My Hero Academia\u2019s cast while setting the stage for the epic confrontation that lies ahead.\n\nBy weaving in brief shots of Dabi and his Vanguard Action Squad amongst the intense training the students are undergoing to strengthen their Quirks, \"Kota\" builds upon the sense of urgency that was so well presented in \"Wild, Wild Pussycats.\" Dabi's cool and collected demeanor is unsettling in a way we haven't seen from My Hero Academia's villains in the past, and the brief glimpses at the maniacal Toga sporting a black mask are wonderfully creepy.\n\n\"Kota\" treats us to another well executed montage where each member of Class A furiously works to strengthen their Quirks. Some of their exercises are quite clever, like Bakugo submerging his hands in boiling water to expand his sweat glands, while others, like Kaminari electrocuting himself by running a current through a large capacity battery, are quite funny, thanks to the exaggerated animation that emphasizes its impact.\n\nMy Hero Academia Episode 41: \"Kota\" 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 16 Todoroki works to master his Quirk 01 16 Todoroki works to master his Quirk My Hero Academia Episode 41: \"Kota\" Download Image Captions ESC\n\nAll signs point to an increased role for the Class B students in the episodes to come, and seeing their homeroom teacher Sekijiro attempt build them up so they can rise above the shadow of Class A was heartwarming. Additionally, his explanation of how to strengthen one's Quirk, likening it to the process of damaging muscle fibers so they can repair and become stronger, was an excellent illustration that provides real-world example the viewer can relate to.\n\nAs its title implies, \"Kota\" also spends a fair bit of time on Kota, and Deku's desire to reach him. Much like how Deku broke through to Todoroki during the sports festival, Deku sees a brokenness within Kota and wants to help him. Given the circumstances of his parents' deaths, Kota's disdain for the way in which society is built around pro heroes is understandable, but unhealthy. Deku realizes this when no one else does, and this awareness of others is what truly makes Deku a hero.\n\nDeku's conversation with Todoroki hammers home this point. The fact that Todoroki didn't even know who Kota was when Deku mentioned him in conversation isn't so much an indication of how selfish Todoroki is, but rather how selfless Deku is. While all of the other students are so focused on strengthening their Quirks, Deku can't help but see the needs of those around him. The strength of My Hero Academia's writing is what makes these moments so powerful and its cast of characters so relatable and memorable.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\n\"Kota\" also does an excellent job at showing us how much the students of Class A have grown and how much more growing they still have yet to do. When it's time to cook, we see Todoroki ignite a flame with clear control over his fire Quirk. Conversely, the destruction caused by Bakugo's explosive rage makes it clear he's going to need to learn to control his anger if he's ever going to be a help to the group.\n\nMeanwhile, the kids who failed their exams are stuck taking extra lessons. The horror on Ashido's face when she's told she can't participate in the test of courage is simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious, thanks to some incredibly wild facial expressions. It's clear they're all at different places in their journeys to become pro heroes, and the ominous way in which \"Kota\" concludes has me eager to see how the students will rise up to handle the oncoming ambush from Dabi and his villainous crew."}, {"link": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/21/gchq-warns-public-absolute-protection-not-possible-arranges/", "title": "GCHQ warns public \u2018absolute protection is not possible\u2019 as it arranges meetings with rail chiefs", "text": "Britain\u2019s spy agencies cannot offer \u201cabsolute protection\u201d against Russian cyber attacks and are instead focused on preventing assaults that would \u201cmost impact on our way of life\u201d, in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning, GCHQ is warning.\n\nWriting in The Sunday Telegraph, Ciaran Martin, the head of the agency\u2019s cyber defence unit, says it is a matter of \u201cwhen, not if\u201d Britain faces a \u201cserious cyber attack\u201d.\n\nHe added that its focus was now on building \u201cresilience\u201d in \u201cthe systems we care about the most\u201d, believed to be Britain\u2019s power and water supplies, internet and transport networks, and health service.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph understands that senior representatives of utility, transport and internet firms and the NHS have attended intelligence briefings at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on the specific methods - known as \u201cattack vectors\u201d - being used by Russia to target Britain\u2019s critical national infrastructure, following the nerve agent attack in Salisbury last month.\n\nSeparately, the NCSC is understood to have written to the Government setting out urgent actions that departments and individual officials should take to protect Whitehall from cyber assaults."}, {"link": "https://www.axios.com/trump-considering-full-pardon-for-boxer-jack-johnson-8c34ff0b-4df6-478e-bc28-fef19134e89d.html?utm_source=sidebar", "title": "Trump considering full pardon for late boxer Jack Johnson", "text": "The International Monetary Fund believes that the world economy could grow 3.9% over \"this year and next,\" the AP reports, which \"would be the fastest since 2011.\"\n\nBut, but, but: The IMF's policymaking committee said \"a strong world economy is threatened by increasing tension over trade and a heavy global debt load.\" Per the AP, the trade war between China and the U.S. could \"drag down worldwide growth.\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued in favor of the administration, saying what drags down the global economy is \"unfair global trade practices.\""}, {"link": "https://www.foxsports.com/mlb", "title": "MLB", "text": "4\n\nAaron Judge goes deep on 3-0 pitch for his 6th home run of the year"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxsports.com%2Fsoccer%2Fvideo%2F1216331843875%3Futm_campaign%3Dshare_buttons%26utm_medium%3Dfscom%26utm_content%3Dreturn_visit%26utm_term%3Dsf%26utm_source%3Dshare_fb", "title": "", "text": "Email address or phone number: Password: Forgotten account?\n\nLog into your Facebook account to share."}, {"link": "http://ew.com/movies/2018/04/21/verne-troyer-dead-austin-powers/", "title": "Verne Troyer, <em>Austin Powers</em>\u00a0actor, dead at 49", "text": "Verne Troyer, who famously starred as Mini-Me in the Austin Powers movies, died on Saturday.

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does? No 10 has so far insisted that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d and that Britain will be leaving the customs union, but may be inclined to change its position once the potential risks to the UK\u2019s economic outlook become clearer. Alamy\n\n2/7 Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party\u2019s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a \u201cspecific solution\u201d would need to be found. Getty\n\n3/7 Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier (seen here with EU Minister David Davis) has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. Rex\n\n4/7 Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty\n\n5/7 Future trade agreement (with the EU) Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU. Infighting within the Cabinet has prevented a solid position from being reached, with some MPs content that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" while others rally behind single market access. The EU has already confirmed that access to the single market would be impossible without the UK remaining in the customs union. Getty Images\n\n6/7 Future trade agreements (internationally) The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London. However the UK cannot make trade agreements with another country while it is still a member of the EU, and the potential loss of trade with the world's major powers is a source of anxiety for the PM. The EU has said the UK cannot secure trade deals during the transition period. EPA\n\n7/7 Financial services Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal. However according to new reports Germany has suggested allowing trade on the condition that the UK continues paying into the EU budget even after the transition period.

You crave, we deliver.\" \"\u2026 request a California Chicken Sandwich and watch as we deliver it to your curbside.\"\n\nUber imposes this \"fiction\" on restaurants to minimise its responsibility, according to Ben Robertson of Carroll & O'Dea Lawyers.\n\n\"The real nature of the problem is [Uber's contract] shifts the responsibility and the risk of delivery and logistics onto the restaurant, but the restaurant really has no control over the routes the driver takes,\" Mr Robertson said.\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, Uber maintained that: \"Uber Eats is a marketplace that connects restaurants with delivery partners and eaters through our technology.\"\n\nWho's working for who?\n\nAnother \"fiction\" is Uber's requirement for restaurateurs to consent to a term that says \"Delivery Partners\" (in other words, its drivers or riders) are \"your agent\".\n\nSeveral restaurateurs have complained to the ABC that they actually have no control over Uber's drivers \u2014 whose workload and wages are controlled by Uber through its app.\n\nUber goes to great lengths to distance itself from any perceived control over the drivers or riders.\n\nTo become an Uber driver or rider, applicants have to agree that: \"I am not an employee, subcontractor or agent of Uber.\"\n\nThe implications of who controls the drivers \u2014 whether it's Uber or the restaurants \u2014 are serious.\n\nMr Robertson explained: \"So the restaurant could give a piping hot pizza to the Uber driver.\"\n\n\"But by the time it gets to the consumer, because of the route the driver takes, or the number of deliveries he takes along the way, it could be stone cold by the time it gets to the customer.\"\n\nThe disgruntled customer would then want a refund, which leads to further complications in Uber's contract with restaurateurs.\n\nGiven the huge scale of Uber Eats' delivery operations, mistakes do occasionally happen, its general manager concedes.\n\n\"When we're delivering at this scale, some orders don't get there in less than 30 minutes,\" said Jodie Auster, the head of Uber Eats (Australia and New Zealand).\n\n\"Some orders don't get there in the way they had originally been intended.\"\n\nWho's responsible for ruining 'Fat Friday'?\n\nOne thing is apparent in Uber's contract with Portier Pacific (its Australian subsidiary) and restaurant owners \u2014 many of which are small business owners \u2014 is that Uber seeks to minimise its liability as much as possible.\n\nIts terms suggest the restaurateur has a lot more control over the entire delivery process than they actually do.\n\nFor instance, restaurateurs are \"responsible for the delivery of meals\" and they \"maintain possession, control, and care of the meals at all times\".\n\nIf the customers complain about the meal being substandard, then Uber has the power to \"deduct refunds\" from the restaurateur.\n\nWhat then is a \"Substandard Meal\", according to the contract?\n\nIt's a meal that falls outside Uber's \"safe temperature range\". For hot food like pizzas and burgers, it must not fall below 60 degrees Celsius.\n\nFor cold food like ice-cream, it must not rise above 5 degrees Celsius.\n\nBut the complication is, if Uber's riders or drivers take too long in delivering the customers' food and it arrives late, Uber has the power to force restaurateurs to pay for the refund.\n\n\"Uber decides whether or not to refund the customer and can assign responsibility for the problem [to the restaurant],\" Mr Robertson said.\n\n\"And the restaurant has no control over process.\"\n\nLate delivery was the most common complaint about Uber's delivery drivers that restaurant owners and customers made to the ABC.\n\nOne disappointed customer was carpenter Carl Sierra, who has been ordering lunch via Uber Eats deliveries every week for the past 14 months, as part of a routine he calls \"Fat Friday\".\n\n\"In recent weeks, we've had dishes that were 'meant to come' not come, drinks that [end up] warm, and [hot] food that [arrives] cold,\" Mr Sierra said.\n\n\"When you've been slaving away on the building site, it's a disappointing thing.\"\n\n'Judge, jury and executioner'\n\n\"The problem with the relationship here is there's a real inequality in the bargaining positions between Uber and the small business operators,\" Mr Robertson said.\n\nHe said the clearest example was this clause: \"by using the Uber Services \u2026 you are bound by any future amendments and additions to this Agreement\".\n\nThis term gives Uber the right to vary the contract \u2014 a power which the restaurant does not have.\n\nUber used its power under this clause to amend its refund policy in early February.\n\nWhile Uber used to cover the cost of customer refunds, it now requires restaurant owners to pay a percentage of that refund in cases of \"missing items\", \"incorrect items\" and \"incorrect orders\".\n\nMs Auster defended Uber's policy change.\n\n\"We believe it is reasonable and fair for restaurants to contribute when they've forgotten to put an item in the bag,\" Ms Auster said.\n\n\"We also know that more than 70 per cent of our restaurants in a month have no missing or wrong food items.\"\n\nCaitlin Craufurd, who owns the Petty Cash cafe in Sydney, severed her ties with Uber because she did not believe there was much transparency in how the company would make its blame-apportionment decision.\n\n\"They are judge, jury and executioner, and I think that's really unfair,\" Ms Craufurd said.\n\n\"I just decided you're taking 35 per cent, and now you're going to pass some of these costs onto me like a feudal overlord would \u2014 I'm not using you anymore.\"\n\n'It isn't for everyone'\n\nJosh Arthurs, the owner of Burgers by Josh, also made the same decision last week, partly for economic reasons.\n\n\"By the time they take that 35 per cent, which is what most restaurants work on as a gross profit, you're not making any gross profit anyway,\" Mr Arthurs told the ABC.\n\n\"Basically you're doing it for free with Uber Eats.\"\n\nSo why do small business restaurants sign the contract, knowing that Uber will take 35 per cent of their revenue?\n\nEssentially, it's a fear of missing out, according to Chrissy Symeonakis, head of Creative Little Soul, a marketing agency with a specialty in the food industry.\n\n\"When delivery came along, they were given not really much of a choice,\" Ms Symeonakis said.\n\n\"Restaurant owners are thinking: This is a new technology, but we don't understand new tech.\n\n\"But we need to get on board with [it], because now this is what the customer wants.\"\n\nAnd how can Uber justify its significant commissions, given the average restaurant profit margin is 2-4 per cent (according to the Restaurant & Catering Industry Association of Australia)?\n\n\"It isn't for everyone,\" Ms Auster said.\n\n\"And some restaurants do decide that they don't want to be in this online delivery game.\n\n\"But the market has spoken. The consumer has spoken. They love this product, and it continues to grow.\"\n\nBotched deliveries and ruined reputations\n\nMr Arthurs said another reason why he cut ties with Uber was \"one too many\" botched deliveries.\n\nHe alleges Uber's delivery drivers, on several occasions, delivered meals to his customers more than an hour late \u2014 with hot food turning up cold, and cold drinks ending up warm \u2014 and sometimes with food or drink items missing.\n\nThe flow-on effect was that disgruntled customers began posting scathing reviews about the Uber Eats delivery service on his restaurant's Google page, which he felt unfairly affected his review score.\n\n\"Before \u2026 we had about 4.2 or 4.3 stars, but since using Uber Eats, it's dropped a lot,\" Mr Arthurs said.\n\n\" And the majority of the recent complaints are from unhappy Uber Eats customers who have ordered our product, which has been mishandled during transportation.\"\n\nOne reviewer named Maddy Linke posted a one-star review about Josh's restaurant stating: \"We got cold popcorn chicken that tasted like rubber, cold chips which nobody bothered to eat and our drinks were HOT.\"\n\nThe burger shop owner posted a public reply to Ms Linke with an apology: \"Very sorry for your experience. We are investigating what has happened, often uberEATS drivers will take on too many orders: and therefore unfortunately deliver food cold.\"\n\nMr Arthurs complained, but there was not much Uber could do to help him.\n\nAn Uber Eats account manager wrote to Mr Arthurs in late February:\n\n\"We give Eater's [sic] the ability to rate and leave comments related to the delivery of their order on the app.\" \"We hope they choose to leave this type of feedback here and not on Google. \"Unfortunately we cannot stop Eaters from leaving comments elsewhere, and nor can we tell them to remove these comments. I know this is frustrating.\"\n\nAn Uber spokesperson told the ABC on Friday: \"Uber Eats relies on our restaurant partners to make our marketplace work.\n\n\"We know there is significant competition for restaurant partners and we will continue to work hard to deliver a great service to those restaurants which choose to use our app.\"\n\nACCC and unfair driver contracts\n\nUber, along with several other companies, came under the radar of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last year as part of its crackdown on unfair contract terms.\n\nThe consumer watchdog raised concerns about Uber's standard contract with its drivers \u2014 in particular, a term allowing Uber to terminate the agreement \"without cause\".\n\nThe company then amended that contract in light of the ACCC's concerns.\n\n\"Uber amended its standard Driver Agreement that allowed it to terminate the agreement 'without cause',\" the ACCC noted.\n\n\"Its right to termination is now limited to certain circumstances including where acting reasonably in order to protect its legitimate interests.\"\n\nUnfair terms and restaurants\n\nMr Robertson believes the terms in the Uber Eats contract place the company at risk of breaching the unfair contract provisions of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), in particular, the term that gives it the power to vary the contract whenever it likes.\n\nThis is in addition to the terms stating Uber does not provide \"delivery services\", and clauses which require restaurateurs to take on more responsibility (for \"Substandard Meals\" and refunds) \u2014 despite their lack of control over Uber's drivers in reality.\n\nHe explained that the ACL protects small businesses (20 employees or fewer), who enter contracts that are worth $300,000 or less \u2014 or $1 million or less, if the contract term is for more than one year.\n\n\"Where there's a term that results in a real inequality between the parties, and doesn't reasonably protect the legitimate rights of a business, the ACL can step in to cure the problem in the contrac,\" Mr Robertson said.\n\n\"The parties can seek a [court] declaration to remove that term from the contract.\"\n\nThe effect of this would mean the offending terms cannot are unenforceable by the stronger party.\n\nUber denies that the contractual terms for its food delivery app are unfair.\n\n\"The terms and conditions for restaurant partners are consistent with Australian law and vital to supporting the thriving marketplace for restaurants, delivery partners and eaters,\" Uber's spokesperson said.\n\n\"Restaurants aren't locked in, just like delivery partners and eaters. If a restaurant does not wish to use the app, they do not have to.\"\n\nSo what is his advice for businesses which fear they have entered into unfair contracts?\n\nIn this specific case, he recommends that restaurants could try \"negotiating directly with Uber to vary the terms of the contract\".\n\nBut given the \"inequality of bargaining power\" he mentioned, that is unlikely to succeed.\n\nAs alternatives, he recommended lodging a complaint to the ACCC or seeking independent legal advice (provided the restaurant has enough funds for that).\n\nIf you are a restaurateur, customer or driver with further information, you can contact us anonymously.\n\nTopics: business-economics-and-finance, company-news, hospitality, australia\n\nFirst posted"}, {"link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/verne-troyer-dead-49-after-12405413", "title": "Austin Powers star Verne Troyer dies at the age of 49", "text": "Get celebs updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

We weren't in any gangs and we didn't go clubbing.\n\n\"We were just two teenagers.\"\n\nWeeks after the murder, the Metropolitan Police had received sufficient hearsay evidence from members of the community to investigate the five white young men who were later accused of his murder.\n\nYet they were obstinate in their refusal to treat the murder as a racial attack.\n\nCaught in the crossfire of the investigation, Duwayne and Stephen himself were implicated by the police under the assumption that the murder was a drug-related dispute between \"two black boys\".\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"The police kept questioning me about what Steve might have had when he was murdered or what he might have done,\" recalled\u00c2 Duwayne.\n\n\"They said they found gloves in his bag, and so they asked me whether or not he had done any burglaries.\n\n\"There was also a belief maybe that I inflicted the injuries, and I was trying to blame it on a group of boys.\n\n\"They suggested when we were at McDonald's earlier that night, he might have interfered with some white girls outside and the attackers may have been her brothers.\n\n\"They were questioning Steve's integrity and questioning mine, so I knew they weren't out to do anything positive.\"\n\nIt was not until Nelson Mandela met the Lawrence family the same year that arrests were finally made.\n\nAfter the charges were dropped because of the supposedly unreliable nature of Duwayne's evidence, it was the sheer persistence and indomitable will of Stephen's parents and a group of campaigners that led to the launch of the first private murder prosecution case in almost 150 years.\n\nBut all hope seemed lost after the Metropolitan Police were exonerated of any wrongdoing, and three of the murderers - Neil Acourt, Luke Knight, and Gary Dobson - were acquitted when Duwayne's witness testimony was ruled inadmissible in September 1994.\n\nAfter Jack Straw, the then home secretary,announced a public inquiry, it was the landmark publication of the Macpherson Report in 1999 that was to radically transform race relations in Britain.\n\nIt turned the spotlight squarely on racism within the Metropolitan Police and diagnosed what black Britons had been calling out for decades with a single phrase: institutional racism.\n\nReport recommendations\u00c2\n\nThe report made 70 recommendations that would bring public institutions under the umbrella of race relations legislation.\n\nAmong some of the tangible results, the Macpherson Report discarded \"double jeopardy\", which allowed Stephen's killers to be tried again for the same crime in 2011, when Gary Dobson and Neil Acourt were found guilty.\n\nIt also led to the creation of the Independant Police Complaints Commissions (IPCC) among numerous other changes.\n\nBut 25 years on, since Stephen's murder, the initial zeal for endemic change is waning.\n\n\"Xenophobia legitimised by Brexit discussions has gathered such a pace, that there's a feeling not a great deal has changed even though in reality quite a bit has\", says Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote.\n\n\"There was a big push for every institution to have a race equality strategy. But the tragedy is after 9/11 and 7/7, the focus switched from tackling race and inequality to tackling the enemies within.\n\n\"This week we've seen the debacle of immigration policy demonising and hounding the Windrush generation.\n\n\"Worryingly, in recent years we've had ramped up stop and search. The rise of young black men dying on the streets is symptomatic of a society that doesn't afford literally tens of thousands of young people equality of opportunity.\"\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nFor Zubaida Haque, a research associate and consultant at race equality think-tank Runnymede Trust, evidence pointing to the continued marginalising and criminalising of black men is proof that institutional racism persists.\n\n\"If you look at the police at the moment, black boys are visible to them when it comes to policing but invisible when it comes to protecting,\" she said.\n\n\"Stop and search still disproportionally impacts on BME people, particularly black people.\"\n\nAccording to the governments disparity unit, black men are six to eight times more likely than white men to be stopped.\n\nThe differential arrest figures from the Lammy Review found that young black men are three times more likely to be arrested compare with their white peers.\n\n\"When we look at deaths in police custody, black people are more likely to have disproportionate excessive force used against them,\" Haque said.\n\n\"It was only last year that we had the death of Rashan Charles and Edson Da Costa, yet not a single police officer has been convicted.\"\n\nRacialised narrative\n\nThe racialised narrative surrounding the recent surge in youth violence is of particular concern to Haque.\u00c2\n\n\"When you look at knife crime I find it extraordinary how the police talk about black men without actually saying 'black men'. They've deliberately been trying to 'other' them in terms of gangs and crime,\" she said.\n\n\"It says that black men are criminal but nothing about how the police have stopped protecting them, how they're vulnerable or living in disproportionately high-crime areas where they feel they have to protect themselves because the police certainly aren't.\n\n\"There aren't other safety nets to look after young men.\n\n\"So they're doing things to protect themselves, which includes carrying a knife.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\n\"The irony is that's exactly what happened during Stephen Lawrence's racist murder.\n\n\"They initially questioned his role in his own murder.\"\n\nFor Duwayne, the new surge in youth violence is the symptom of an acute mental-health crisis.\n\n\"As an eighteen-year-old, I didn't have anyone to speak to about the impact of Steve's murder, the court process, my experience with the criminal justice system, the private prosecution, the stop-and-search, the behaviour of the police,\" he said.\n\n\"All of those experiences were traumatic. Black people and young people per se aren't accessing mental health services, trauma counselling or victim support.\n\n\"Untreated trauma is very dangerous, and we're seeing it on the streets with people who have extreme anger management problems.\n\n\"Many of these perpetrators are repeat victims whose issues have never been resolved, their trauma has never been spoken about.\"\n\nA quarter of a century on, Duwayne's suspicion of the police remains, and understandably so.\n\nAfter testifying against the Metropolitan Police for the Macpherson Report and filing to sue for racism, his car has inexplicably been broken into on numerous occasions, and he has been stopped by police. and. on one occasion, arrested for always resulting in acquittals.\n\nInsipid fruits of racism\n\nA Home Office-commissioned inquiry in 2014 reported that an undercover police officer was commanded to spy on the Lawrence family campaign and on Duwayne, to collect intelligence that might help \"smear\" the Lawrence family and undermine public sympathy.\n\nIt took the murder of Stephen Lawrence for Britain to hold up a mirror to itself and face the bitter truth that far from being a utopian multicultural society, the insipid fruits of racism and institutional racism had fastened its iron grip not only on individuals but within public institutions as well.\n\nThe British racial landscape has been altered irrevocably. But for Stephen's family and friends and for Duwayne, a victim himself in one of the most profound miscarriages of justice in British history, the loss of Stephen will forever be inconsolable.\n\n\"We move on every day as we learn and gain more experience. But what happened to Steve, that experience will always be there. That's never going to change.\""}, {"link": "https://www.foxsports.com/nascar/video/1216355907824", "title": "Denny Hamlin & Kaitlyn Vincie reminisce about their early years in racing at Langley Speedway (VIDEO)", "text": "Video Details\n\nDenny Hamlin and Kaitlyn Vincie take a trip back to their home track of Langley Speedway in Virginia to look back on how they both got started in racing."}, {"link": "http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/21/yes-westworlds-hosts-poop-says-showrunner", "title": "Yes, Westworld's Hosts Poop, Says Showrunner - IGN", "text": "Share. \"The hosts are basically organic.\" \"The hosts are basically organic.\"\n\nWestworld's hosts do indeed have to deal with basic biological needs, such as pooping.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Westworld co-creator and co-showrunner Lisa Joy shed some light on just how human these hosts really are.

She said she had seen with her \u201cown eyes\u201d how Leave.EU had apparently targeted customers of Eldon Insurance \u2013 owned by Banks \u2013 using their private data to promote anti-Europe messaging.\n\nBanks, Leave.EU and Eldon have vehemently denied having shared any such data, either with each other or with Cambridge Analytica. But a \u201csubject access request\u201d submitted to Eldon has revealed that it holds data not just on its own customers, but also on people who have submitted a query to a price comparison website (PCW), which involves them agreeing to the site\u2019s privacy terms.\n\nA subject access request is a legal mechanism for individuals to obtain information from companies about what personal information the company holds about them, why it is held and how it is used. Such a request has revealed that personal details from a car insurance query to the PCW Moneysupermarket were passed to Eldon and held in its database. The data included name, date of birth, address, email address, details of friends and family and telephone number. In its last annual report, Moneysupermarket said that it held data on 24.9 million people \u2013 or about half the British electorate.\n\nA spokesman for Moneysupermarket said: \u201cOur providers use the personal information from our customers to generate personalised quotes for the service they have asked for (such as quoting for car insurance) and are not allowed to use this information for anything else unless they have permission from the customer.\u201d\n\nPotential customers who use most price comparison websites enter multiple pieces of sensitive personal information into an inquiry form that is then passed to partner companies. The privacy terms of the PCWs make clear that such data sharing may occur. The fact that this happens, however, raises the prospect that people who simply searched for insurance online via a PCW could have had their private information shared in a way they might not have realised.\n\nRavi Naik, a lawyer who specialises in data rights, said it would be \u201can astonishing misuse\u201d of data. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely huge,\u201d he said. \u201cIn theory, commercial operators could have access to almost every voter in the UK.

The Leave.EU campaign was based inside its headquarters in Bristol.\n\nKaiser described a visit to the offices and told MPs that she had seen with her \u201cown eyes\u201d that Leave.EU staff were using insurance customers\u2019 data to target them with political messaging.\n\n\u201cI was under the impression, by what they told me, that every single individual that they were pulling up to call was actually a lead or a current customer of Eldon Insurance or GoSkippy,\u201d she said.\n\nLeave.EU said that Kaiser\u2019s testimony was \u201ca confused litany of lies and allegations\u201d. Lawyers for Banks and Eldon said such allegations were \u201chighly defamatory\u201d, that none of these allegations was true, and that there was no evidence to support them. They said Leave.EU and Eldon have never shared any data and that Leave.EU has never shared any data with Cambridge Analytica, whether in relation to the referendum or otherwise.\n\nArron Banks, the insurers and my strange data trail Read more\n\nLast week, the Observer revealed that Leave.EU and Banks had received \u201cinformation notices\u201d from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the same week that the regulator had conducted a raid on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s office and seized computer equipment. Both actions are part of its year-long investigation into the use of data in the referendum.\n\nThe DCMS committee, which is conducting an inquiry into fake news, also published interviews that Emma Briant, a lecturer in propaganda at Essex University, conducted with directors of Cambridge Analytica and the Leave.EU campaign. It included a recording of Andy Wigmore \u2013 a director of Eldon Insurance and spokesman for Leave.EU \u2013 making claims about how Eldon\u2019s actuaries had been used to analyse data during the referendum.\n\nWigmore told the Guardian last week that no actuaries had been employed by the campaign. Last year, he told the Observer that the campaign had used artificial intelligence that it had developed inside Eldon\u2019s headquarters. He said: \u201cIn insurance you have actuaries.

Two weeks ago, he allowed key Republican legislators to review an almost completely unredacted F.B.I. memo on the opening of a still active investigation of the Trump campaign, a rare step. He later summoned two other Republicans, Mr. Jordan and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, to his office to pledge that the Justice Department would be more responsive to their requests.\n\nAnd on Thursday, threatened with a subpoena, he gave a relatively large group of lawmakers access to memos written by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey about his interactions with Mr. Trump. The documents are considered to be important evidence in a potential obstruction of justice case against the president being weighed by Mr. Mueller.\n\nBut still other Republican demands remain unmet, and Democrats have warned that Mr. Rosenstein is being boxed into a corner where he has to choose between saving his job and setting disturbing precedents that chip away at the independence that the Justice Department has maintained since President Richard M. Nixon tried to thwart the Watergate investigation. \u201cThat independence keeps the country from sliding into a banana republic,\u201d said Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.\n\nStephen E. Boyd, the Justice Department\u2019s assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, said, \u201cThe department is responding to what it believes to be good faith requests for information pursuant to Congress\u2019s appropriate oversight function, and the department is doing so in a way that will not have any adverse impact on ongoing investigations.\u201d\n\nOthers said they worried that in solving his short-term political problems, Mr. Rosenstein could expose the department to increasingly onerous congressional demands into continuing investigations \u2014 an area that has traditionally been off limits.\n\n\u201cIt could become an exception that swallows the rule,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a former federal prosecutor. \u201cEvery request by Congress can be made to seem exceptional.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResolving such dilemmas is but one of the challenges Mr. Rosenstein faces. Mr. Trump claimed this month, without offering evidence, that he suffers from conflicts of interest and has criticized him for signing a warrant application to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide. Every week seems to bring a new rumor that Mr. Trump plans to fire Mr. Rosenstein, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Mueller or all three.\n\nIn one of Washington\u2019s odder embraces, their strongest defenders are congressional Democrats who abhor the Justice Department\u2019s policies under the Trump administration but see Mr. Rosenstein as a firewall between the president and the special counsel.\n\nMr. Rosenstein declined requests for an interview, but supporters say he is well positioned to defend himself. A careful and conservative lawyer, he is unlikely to make missteps or overstep boundaries, they say. A high-ranking former Justice Department official described him as \u201cthe ultimate survivor.\u201d\n\nEarly in his tenure, he stumbled when he wrote a memo to Mr. Sessions castigating Mr. Comey for speaking publicly about the F.B.I. investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information while secretary of state. Although Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited it as justification for firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Rosenstein told Congress that the memo was not meant to \u201cjustify a for-cause termination.\u201d Even so, he acknowledged that he knew Mr. Comey\u2019s job was in danger when he wrote it.\n\n\u201cRod got suckered by the president in writing the memo,\u201d said Philip B. Heymann, a former Justice Department official and one of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s mentors. \u201cTrump marched his deputy attorney general way out on a limb and then left him there.\u201d\n\nHe and others suggest that Mr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel partly to redeem himself.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Sessions has scant ability to provide his deputy cover. If the president is mulling Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s fate, he holds a deeper animus toward Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nMr. Rosenstein addresses his own jeopardy with a blend of stoicism and black humor, according to friends. \u201cI may need to talk to you about a job,\u201d he jested to one Washington-area lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe is not, however, trying to whip up political support for himself. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t do the self-preservation game,\u201d said James M. Trusty, a friend who worked with him in Maryland. \u201cHe\u2019s very grounded and fatalistic. He plays it by the book.\u201d\n\nMr. Rosenstein is proceeding as though he will not be fired. On Monday, he is arguing a sentencing guidelines case on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Rosenstein grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs, attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1989. He became a trial lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s public integrity section in Washington and eventually worked with Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton\u2019s business dealings. In 2005, President George W. Bush appointed him the United States attorney for Maryland. President Barack Obama kept him on.\n\nThe office he ran had been torn apart by political infighting and had a weak relationship with local law enforcement. In his first few months, Mr. Rosenstein gathered information from employees about what had gone wrong, then restructured the office. He reached out to state prosecutors and encouraged his staff members to work with them to fight violent crime. His ability to transcend politics gave him credibility, according to many who worked with him.\n\n\u201cI never heard a political word escape from his lips,\u201d said Brian E. Frosh, the Democratic Maryland attorney general. \u201cHe was smart, honest, fair, tough \u2014 everything you want in a prosecutor.\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions barely knew Mr. Rosenstein when he became his deputy, and Mr. Rosenstein had no obvious political patron. He was not expecting to become a household name: When his daughter asked whether his new job meant that he was now famous, he told her that few people know or care who served as deputy attorney general.\n\nHe and Mr. Sessions had little in common beyond their lengthy tenures as federal prosecutors and shared views on gangs, drugs and violent crime. And the tensions that almost always exist between attorneys general and their deputies have been exacerbated by the special counsel investigation and the resulting political pressures.\n\nBut associates say the men have bonded in the face of attacks from the White House.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump publicly exploded against Mr. Rosenstein this month, Mr. Sessions called Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, to warn that firing the deputy attorney general would have damaging consequences, including the possible resignation of Mr. Sessions himself, according to a person briefed on the conversation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sessions told Mr. McGahn that the president needed to know that he believed that firing Mr. Rosenstein would be a misstep and that he had done nothing to justify such an ouster.\n\nMr. Rosenstein\u2019s oversight of the special counsel\u2019s office gives him broad powers to approve or veto Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigative requests. Democrats and some Republicans worry that the president could fire Mr. Rosenstein and install a replacement who would use that power to narrow the scope of the special counsel\u2019s inquiry.\n\nDemocratic senators have circulated a document arguing that a new deputy attorney general could deny Mr. Mueller the power to take investigative steps and decline to sign off on staff or resources, essentially undermining the investigation without officially ending it or prompting the kind of Republican backlash on Capitol Hill that firing Mr. Mueller almost certainly would. A new appointee could also refuse to publicly release a report when Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation concludes.\n\nMr. Rosenstein has made efforts to head off conflicts with the White House. Soon after the F.B.I. raided the office, home and hotel room of the president\u2019s lawyer Michael D. Cohen this month, infuriating the president, Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Trump met. Mr. Trump emerged telling people that Mr. Rosenstein had said he was not a target of the investigation into Mr. Cohen\u2019s activities, according to two people with knowledge of the president\u2019s account. Justice Department officials declined to comment on the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, the president\u2019s staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill have put themselves in one standoff after another with Mr. Rosenstein. Among others, he has faced escalating demands and complaints from three committee chairmen: Representatives Robert W. Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee, Devin Nunes of the Intelligence Committee and Trey Gowdy of the Oversight Committee.\n\nIn an interview this month on Fox News, Mr. Nunes threatened to hold Mr. Rosenstein in contempt or even impeach him if he failed to turn over the complete copy of the F.B.I. memo justifying the initiation of the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. Mr. Rosenstein called him to the Justice Department and gave him and other Intelligence Committee members access the next day to a version of the memo that satisfied their concerns.\n\nIn a separate request, Mr. Goodlatte and others have issued a subpoena for hundreds of thousands of documents \u2014 an extraordinary number even for Congress \u2014 related to the Clinton inquiry, the firing of the F.B.I.\u2019s former deputy director and other matters. When the lawmakers began complaining that the documents were coming slowly and with too much content blacked out, the Justice Department appointed a United States attorney in Illinois to oversee document review and production. The F.B.I. doubled the number of employees working on responses to a request for materials the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general was using to 54 people working two shifts a day, from 8 a.m. to midnight.\n\nBut some Republicans are still unsatisfied and have said a contempt citation or even impeachment \u2014 exceedingly rare steps that would require votes in the House \u2014 are still possibilities. Democrats fear that, taken together, the Republican requests are meant to offer Mr. Trump cover or even cause to fire Mr. Rosenstein.\n\nIn a meeting with Mr. Rosenstein in recent days, Mr. Jordan and Mr. Meadows tried to impress upon him that they needed the documents they sought. Otherwise, Mr. Meadows said later, lawmakers would be left with no choice but to begin building a case to hold Mr. Rosenstein in contempt of Congress or to try to impeach him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cContempt is obviously still on the horizon,\u201d Mr. Meadows said, \u201cif there is not a substantial change.\u201d"}, {"link": "http://fortune.com/2018/04/21/lobbyist-scott-pruitt-leaves-firm/", "title": "Lobbyist Linked to EPA Head Scott Pruitt Leaves Job at Firm", "text": "The lobbyist whose wife rented a bedroom in a Capitol Hill condo to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has left his job as chairman of Williams & Jensen.\n\nJ.

Pruitt was required to leave his bedroom door unlocked and was barred from using common areas, which continued to be a venue for dinner parties and meetings during his stay.\n\nSmithfield Foods\n\nThe controversy encircled Steven Hart too, drawing attention to his clients with business before the EPA. Hart said he didn\u2019t personally lobby the EPA in 2017 or this year, but the newly filed disclosure appears to contradict that claim, and several of his corporate clients had matters pending before the agency.\n\nThat includes pork processor Smithfield Foods Inc., a subsidiary of WH Group Ltd., China\u2019s largest meat producer. A lobbying disclosure filed by Williams & Jensen on Friday shows Hart had some lobbying contact with the EPA on behalf of the company during the first three months of this year. The form doesn\u2019t specify the type or extent of the contact \u2014 just that it involved \u201cissues relating to support for EPA Chesapeake Bay programs.\u201d\n\nVirginia-based Smithfield was fined $12.6 million for dumping hog waste into Chesapeake Bay in 1997, in what was the largest water pollution fine ever at the time. The EPA works with federal and state agencies and non-government programs to coordinate restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and has set pollution limits to keep too much nitrogen, phosphorus and other materials from running off into the bay.\n\nDisclosure Forms\n\n\u201cAn independent review of the firm\u2019s lobbying activity in advance of the quarterly filing deadline concluded that Mr. Hart had lobbying contact with the Environmental Protection Agency in the first quarter of 2018,\u201d Williams & Jensen said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe firm has filed the requisite disclosure forms required by law accordingly.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Smithfield said lobbying by Williams & Jensen wasn\u2019t undertaken \u201cat the direction or on behalf\u201d of the company but at the request of Dennis Treacy, a former Smithfield executive and current board member of the Smithfield Foundation \u2014 the company\u2019s nonprofit philanthropic arm \u2014 in his personal capacity.\n\nHart said Saturday that he\u2019d never lobbied for Smithfield Foods, as the Williams & Jensen lobbying disclosure report showed.\n\nHelping a Friend\n\n\u201cI assisted a friend who served on the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and this is inaccurately being tied to Smithfield Foods,\u201d he said in an emailed statement, referring to Treacy, who is a member of the commission. \u201cI was not paid for this assistance, and any suggestion that I lobbied for Smithfield Foods is inaccurate.\u201d\n\nThe EPA didn\u2019t immediately provide a comment.\n\nHart said he began transitioning to honorary chairman of Williams & Jensen after giving up his chief executive officer title two years ago, was planning to retire from the firm in November, and had begun negotiating a severance agreement earlier this year.\n\nHart told his colleagues he was looking forward to developing an independent legal practice and doing some strategic business counseling for a few clients."}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/climate/pruitt-hart-condo-epa-lobbying.html", "title": "Scott Pruitt Met With Lobbyist Whose Wife Rented Him a $50-a-Night Condo", "text": "A spokesman for Smithfield Foods said that the work Mr. Hart did was on behalf of Mr. Treacy personally, as he is also a member of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, a government entity that works to improve the water quality in the largest estuary in the United States.\n\nThe E.P.A. has its own Chesapeake Bay program office, and it has been working for more than a decade with area states and the District of Columbia to restore the bay\u2019s water quality.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

These activities were conducted at the request of a then former executive and current Smithfield Foundation board member, Dennis Treacy, in his personal capacity.\u201d\n\nMr. Hart disputed on Saturday that his story had changed, saying in a written statement that his work with Mr. Treacy was not compensated and not on behalf of Smithfield. \u201cI assisted a friend who serves on the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and this is inaccurately being tied to Smithfield Foods,\u201d Mr. Hart said. \u201cI was not paid for this assistance and any suggestion that I lobbied for Smithfield Foods is inaccurate.\u201d\n\nThe Smithfield Foods disclosure was made the same day that Mr. Hart announced he was stepping down as chairman of Williams & Jensen \u2014 instead of waiting until his planned November retirement \u2014 citing the negative publicity that had been caused by the Capitol Hill condo rental to Mr. Pruitt.\n\n\u201cConsidering the last couple of weeks, I think it is easier on my family and the firm to expedite my departure,\u201d Mr. Hart wrote in a note to his work colleagues on Friday. \u201cI am very much looking forward to devoting myself to an independent legal practice, some strategic business counseling for a few clients, golf, and shooting (not in that order),\u201d he wrote.\n\nNo details were released by Williams & Jensen or Smithfield about the meeting between Mr. Hart and Mr. Pruitt other than that it took place in early 2017.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPatrick Creighton, the spokesman for Williams & Jensen, said in a written statement on Saturday that the firm was now reviewing its 2017 lobbying disclosure statements and \u201cwill make adjustments if needed once that review is complete,\u201d to acknowledge, if necessary, that the meeting took place.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar from 2017 shows a short meeting on Aug. 1 with Chesapeake Bay Commission leadership that does not disclose who from the organization was present. Agency officials did not respond on Saturday when asked if this was the meeting that involved Mr. Hart.\n\nA spokeswoman for the E.P.A., when previously asked by The Times about any lobbying by Mr. Hart, said that \u201cthere was no connection between where he lived and any decision he made.\u201d The agency sent out that statement again on Saturday when asked about the 2017 meeting with Mr. Hart.\n\nMr. Hart had previously been listed as a lobbyist for companies including Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company that is regulated by the E.P.A."}, {"link": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/04/21/at-sylvester-stallones-urging-trump-weighs-full-pardon-for-boxer-jack-johnson.html", "title": "At Sylvester Stallone's urging, Trump weighs 'full pardon' for boxer Jack Johnson", "text": "President Trump Saturday said that he is considering a \u201cfull pardon\u201d for boxing\u2019s first black heavyweight champion, Jack Johnson, after being urged to do so by \u201cRocky\u201d actor Sylvester Stallone.\n\n\n\nTrump said that Stallone had called him and told him about Johnson, and that he is now considering a posthumous pardon. Stallone is a Trump supporter and attended his New Years' Eve Party in 2016, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\n\n\u201c[Johnson's] trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOthers have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!\u201d\n\n\n\nJohnson, born in Galveston, Texas, was the target of racial resentment, particularly after he defeated white boxer James Jeffries in the 1910 \u201cFight of the Century,\u201d a bout that sparked race riots. Three years later he was convicted by an all-white jury of violating the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport a woman across state lines for \u201cimmoral\u201d purposes.\n\n\n\nIn their efforts to prosecute Johnson, authorities first targeted Johnson's relationship with the woman in question, Lucille Cameron, who later became his wife, but she refused to cooperate.\n\nBut they found another white witness, Belle Schreiber, to testify against him. Johnson fled the country after his conviction, but he agreed years later to return and serve a 10-month jail sentence. He died in 1946.\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been calling for a pardon for Johnson since 2004, and criticized President Obama for leaving office in 2017 without having granted one. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., had also called for a pardon.\n\n\n\n\u201cJohnson\u2019s imprisonment forced him into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice, and continues to stand as a shameful stain on our nation\u2019s history,\u201d McCain said in a statement in January 2017.\n\n\n\nJohnson\u2019s great-great niece has also pressed Trump for a pardon.\n\nPosthumous pardons are rare, but not unprecedented. President Bill Clinton pardoned Henry O. Flipper, the first African-American officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry Regiment during the Civil War; he was framed for embezzlement. Bush pardoned Charles Winters in 2008, an American volunteer in the Arab-Israeli War convicted of violating the U.S. Neutrality Acts in 1949.\n\n\n\nFox News\u2019 Ben Florance and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"link": "http://www.thesportbible.com/football/news-kit-independientes-buttoned-up-retro-kit-is-a-thing-of-beauty-20180421", "title": "Independiente's Buttoned-Up Retro Kit Is A Thing Of Beauty", "text": "It may look like something you'd wear if you were in a bowling team but Argentine outfit Independiente have gone big with their retro kit.\n\nThe Puma-created shirt is inspired by the club's 1948 side which won the league for the third time. 70 years on, the design has been brought back and it's fair to say it's a bit beautiful.\n\nEste es el kit retro completo que vestir\u00e1 #Independiente el pr\u00f3ximo lunes. pic.twitter.com/qA9Ee6tHSn - ADN CAI (@adnCAI) April 20, 2018\n\nIt comes with a collar that we haven't seen on football shirts for ages, as well as buttons up and down the top.\n\nWhile it's not exactly a modern-type kit, fans have been swooning over it on social media:\n\nJust look at Independiente's new limited-edition retro kit.

While the focus is typically on our gut bacteria, our microbiome collectively live on all surfaces of the body, including on our skin and in our mouths.\n\nGrowing recognition of the microbiome has led to it being considered as an organ in its own right. Comprising an estimated 100 trillion cells and weighing about 2 kilograms, we consist of more bacterial than human cells.\n\nMuch of the focus on the microbiome is based on the concept of dysbiosis or a lack of balance in the microbiome.\n\nWhile the concept of symbiosis and dysbiosis refers to the types of relationship between host microorganisms and the body, what constitutes an ideal balance of microbes has not been determined.\n\nEveryone has a unique microbiome that is constantly changing based on our lifestyle, things such as food, exercise, medication and even water consumption. In our research, up to a third of gut bacteria cannot be named.\n\nEstimates from other key scientific groups suggest that as much as two-thirds of the microbiome has yet to be identified.\n\nFurther complicating this picture is our understanding of the interaction between the host and various bacteria is not well known, along with the fact that a majority of microbiome studies are focused on males.\n\nClinics and claims based on \"building a healthy gut microbiota\" or dealing with an \"unbalanced or dysbiotic gut\" must be treated with caution given current knowledge of the microbiome.\n\nCan gut bacteria help with the common cold?\n\nWith initial benefits for gut health, in particular traveller's diarrhoea and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, interest in microbiome therapy is now targeting cancer, obesity and metabolic disease, mental health, autoimmune disease and even sports performance.\n\nScientific evidence supports the use of faecal transplants for clostridium difficile infection, and potentially for some bowel diseases, although in both of these cases faecal transfers are considered a last resort given patients may also be exposed to harmful bacteria present within the donor sample.\n\nOne recent case of faecal microbiome transplant was even associated with weight gain and the development obesity, suggesting that careful consideration is required before taking on this treatment approach.\n\nA key reason for the lack of understanding of the microbiome in health is that insufficient research has been undertaken.\n\nAnimal studies indicate that gut bacteria have a range of effects on the immune system, gut health and metabolism.\n\nHuman studies on the microbiome have had mixed results and in many cases other lifestyle behaviours, such as regular, moderate physical activity, a change in diet or stress management, exert a bigger influence on our health.\n\nWell conducted, scientific research in humans is promising but not yet at the point to support diagnostic or therapeutic recommendations for disease.\n\nThis is particularly evident in the probiotic literature, where considerable research has been undertaken looking at the common cold. Some probiotic bacteria lead to a reduction in the risk of the common cold while other probiotic bacteria have no effect at all, highlighting the need for people to be selective about the supplements they consume.\n\nWhy not get your gut bacteria profiled?\n\nFor those of us conducting research there is the need to recruit people to studies so that the microbiome field can advance.\n\nThis requires people who are healthy and those who have disease to participate in research initiatives.\n\nThere are current studies looking at probiotics and immune health in shift workers, allergic disease, and obesity, along with our own program to allow people to have their microbiome, immune system and metabolic health profiled as a service, called AussieGut.\n\nThese studies allow participants to find out whether a probiotic supplements will work for them and get information on the make-up of their gut bacteria.\n\nWithout involvement in research, the growing excitement and promise of the microbiome field for human health will continue to offer hope and hype, rather than be integrated in medical care.\n\nNicholas West and Amanda Cox are immunology research fellows at the Menzies Health Institute QLD at Griffith University.

We\u2019ve reached out to Amazon and Audible for comment, and will update this post if we hear back. Barnes and Noble doesn\u2019t appear to have any such restrictions for its reviews, and its reviews include a number of anonymous one and five starred reviews.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Amazon has restricted reviews for high-profile books: the company deleted a number of one-star reviews of Hillary Clinton\u2019s book What Happened and Michael Wolfe\u2019s book Fire & Fury: Inside the Trump White House following their publication, under the suspicion that they were published by opponents. Amazon\u2019s Community Guidelines state that it will restrict non-Amazon Verified Purchase reviews for products when the company detects an \u201cunusually high numbers of reviews for a product posted in a short period of time.\u201d\n\nThat policy makes sense, given that high profile books for controversial figures can become the target of opponents or supporters who wish to affect the book\u2019s overall rating.

Accordingly, there are some basic restrictions to tamp down abuse: the site prohibits users from contributing false or misleading reviews, while publishers and authors aren\u2019t allowed to buy reviews to game the system. Indeed, Amazon\u2019s \u201cVerified Buyer\u201d identification is a useful check on attempts to game the system: allowing the company to filter out reviews for high-profile books in some cases, while also restricting users from posting more than five non-verified purchases a week. But that restriction can be annoying for someone who\u2019s purchased the book from a non-Amazon source, but who wants to contribute to the larger body of reviews on Amazon. In all likelihood, they\u2019ll just have to wait for the fervor to die down before they can post their thoughts."}, {"link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-considers-pardon-jack-johnson-after-call-from-sylvester-stallone-2018-04-21/", "title": "Trump considers posthumous pardon of boxer Jack Johnson after call from Sylvester Stallone", "text": "President Trump on Saturday tweeted that he's considering a \"full pardon\" for the late Jack Johnson, the world's first black champion boxer, at the prompting of Sylvester Stallone.

Probably the latter, at this point.\n\nThe Bulls showed off some beautiful, creative touches from set moves and in broken play against the Rebels, but also exited from their own quarter rather too dangerously and over-elaborately, had some issues at the breakdown, and went off the boil mentally at times.\n\nSaturday\u2019s closing game on SA soil, the all-coastal clash at Kings Park, really only underlined how lacking in real confidence or pizzazz both the Sharks and Stormers are.\n\nAn overwhelmingly turgid first half ensued, as they nervously felt each other out, and former Springbok coach Nick Mallett, the SuperSport analyst, lamented some of the \u201ckicking tennis\u201d as possession was too often hoofed aimlessly back from team\u2019s grasp to the other.\n\nFortunately the second period livened up a great deal, and some easy-on-the-eye tries were registered; manna from heaven for another disappointingly sparse crowd.\n\nThe Sharks were fairly good value overall for the victory \u2013 their opponents remain without an away triumph in six attempts \u2013 and did manage on this occasion to bring some of their outside backs into the game more than usual: players like Lukhanyo Am, Makazole Mapimpi and S\u2019bu Nkosi revelled as a result.\n\nNext weekend\u2019s fixtures (home teams first, all kick-offs SA time):\n\nFriday: Hurricanes v Sunwolves, 09:35; Stormers v Rebels, 15:05. Saturday: Reds v Lions, 07:05; Blues v Jaguares, 09:35; Brumbies v Crusaders, 11:45; Bulls v Highlanders, 17:15.

Then we added our special feeling to it.\u201d\n\nGrease was originally a 1971 stage show created by advertising copywriter Jim Jacobs and art teacher Warren Casey. The movie rights were bought by producer Allan Carr and an animated film was planned, but never happened.\n\nThe title paid homage to the 1950s culture of greasy food, greasy hair and greasy engines.\n\nHenry Winkler, alias The Fonz in TV\u2019s Happy Days, rejected the chance to play Danny \u2013 while Marie Osmond turned down the role of Sandy, leaving the way clear for Olivia.\n\nJeff Conaway, 26 \u2013 who died in 2011, aged 60 \u2013 was Danny\u2019s best mate Kenickie. Off screen, he was busy seducing the film\u2019s extras. He had a big crush on Newton-John and went on to marry her sister, Rona. Barry Pearl, who played T-Bird Doody, said: \u201cWe used to joke all the time because his trailer at lunchtime was really rocking. He made out like a bandit.\u201d\n\nThe movie was filmed over a scorching two months at Venice High School in Los Angeles.\n\nDidi Conn, who played Frenchy, said: \u201cThey had to keep the windows closed because next door was a pork plant.\n\n\u201cIt was so smelly, noisy and so very, very hot but everybody was just having fun, dancing and trying new things \u2014 you had to or you\u2019d faint from the heat.\u201d\n\nShe also revealed some of the men had, shall we say, an uncomfortable moment in the angels scene. Didi added: \u201cThe boys said they weren\u2019t afraid to go up high but they didn\u2019t know the harnesses would be so tight around their privates. They were in such pain!\u201d\n\n(Image: www.alamy.com)\n\nAnd she also told how the end-of-movie party has always been a bit of a blur, revealing: \u201cI don\u2019t even remember the wrap party because somebody made some brownies. There was something in it! I won\u2019t mention names... I just remember laughing a lot!\u201d\n\nTravolta, who began shooting Grease four days after finishing Saturday Night Fever, was a particular hit with the ladies.\n\nDinah Manoff, who played Pink Lady Marty when she was 19, said: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t fail to have the biggest crush in the whole world on him. He was radiating so much talent and energy. I just started stuttering around him. Think about that moment he turns around in the film for the first time: you see that face and everybody just gasps.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it was. Really jaw-dropping.\u201d\n\nThe famous National Bandstand scene, which featured an amazing dance-off, took five days to film.\n\nBut the iconic You\u2019re The One That I Want clip was filmed in just a day \u2013 because that\u2019s how long the travelling carnival backdrop was in town.\n\nTravolta badgered film bosses to let him sing Greased Lightnin\u2019, originally written for Conaway\u2019s character. The soundtrack Grease, sung by Frankie Valli, and You\u2019re The One That I Want, a duet by Newton-John and Travolta, topped the US charts.\n\nNewton-John\u2019s Hopelessly Devoted To You even received an Oscar nomination.\n\nGrease 2, starring Michelle Pfeiffer, was released in 1982 and flopped \u2013 so plans for a further two sequels were shelved.\n\nBut there have been more than 123,000 stage versions of Grease around the world.\n\nProof, if any were needed, that it is very much alive and well-a well-a well-a huh!\n\nTell me more, tell me more... did they get very far?\n\nDanny - John Travolta\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\nGrease and Saturday Night Fever saw Travolta become a Hollywood A-lister before he hit a slump.\n\nCareer was rescued by Pulp Fiction and hits Face/Off and Hairspray! followed.\n\nNow 64, a father of three and a believer in Scientology, he stars in upcoming mob film Gotti.\n\nSandy - Olivia Newton-John\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHad a successful music career but faced heartache in her private life.\n\nA boyfriend vanished on a boat trip in 2005 \u2013 then was reportedly found years later.\n\nNow married and with a daughter, Olivia, 69, is battling stage four breast cancer after the disease returned for a second time.\n\nRizzo - Stockard Channing\n\n(Image: Backgrid)\n\nChanning, 74, was struggling to pay the mortgage when she starred in Grease but has had huge success ever since she headed up the Pink Ladies.\n\nShe was First Lady in The West Wing, Julianna Margolis\u2019s crazy mum in The Good Wife and starred in hit film Six Degrees of Separation.\n\nKenickie - Jeff Conaway\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThrice-married Conaway enjoyed two years as struggling actor Bobby Wheeler in sitcom Taxi.\n\nHe endured a long battle with substance abuse, appearing on US show Celebrity Rehab in 2008.\n\nConaway died in 2011, aged 60, after suffering complications from pneumonia.\n\nFrenchy - Didi Conn\n\n(Image: FOX)\n\nFamously pink-haired in Grease, Conn continued to act, with roles in Benson and Shining Time Station.\n\nMarried twice, she is a New Yorker and is now aged 66.\n\nShe became a high-profile campaigner for autism awareness after her son, Daniel, was diagnosed with the condition.\n\nMarty - Dinah Manoff\n\n(Image: Splash)\n\nShe went on to appear in the four Oscar winning film Ordinary People as well as successful horror movie Child\u2019s Play.\n\nBut the actress, who is now aged 60, is best known for her small screen success, with regular roles in the likes of Soap and Empty Nest.\n\nPutzie - Kelly Ward\n\n(Image: Yorkshire Television)\n\nKelly, now 61, took on a few small roles after Grease but largely stepped out of the acting spotlight to direct cartoon shows such as Disney Channel\u2019s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\n\nHas recently worked as a dialogue director for multiple Disney programmes."}, {"link": "http://www.newsweek.com/us-russia-china-respond-north-korea-kim-jong-un-freeze-nuclear-tests-896213", "title": "U.S., Russia and China react as North Korea's Kim Jong Un stops nuclear tests", "text": "President Donald Trump was joined by other world leaders and nations Saturday in praising North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un's decision to halt nuclear and missile tests ahead of major summits aimed at achieving elusive peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAs Kim prepared to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in later this week and Trump sometime in the next month or two, the young ruler announced Friday that nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests would cease immediately and that he would close a nuclear facility in the country's north to prove it. Hours later, Trump shared his reaction to the surprise news on Twitter.\n\n\"A message from Kim Jong Un: \"North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\" Also will \"Shut down a nuclear test site in the country\u2019s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.\u201d Progress being made for all!,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nChina also welcomed the development. Beijing has been Pyongyang's greatest ally since backing North Korea in the mid-20th century war against U.S.-backed South Korea that set the stage for current tensions. As North Korea developed nuclear weapons to deter a potential U.S. invasion, however, China joined in voting for international sanctions against its neighbor and has attempted to serve as a mediary between the U.S. and North Korea, officially called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nKim has been more wary of Chinese influence in his country than his predecessors, however, and went over six years before making an official visit. He made his first trip to Beijing last month soon after inviting Trump to the first face-to-face talks between a North Korean and U.S. leader and appeared to shore up ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Saturday that his government hoped Kim would now focus on improving his country's economic situation, which has been ravaged by harsh U.S.-led sanctions.\n\nRelated: North Korea's Kim Jong Un Says He Will Stop Testing Missiles Ahead of Trump Meeting\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\n\"We believe that the relevant decision made by the DPRK will help to further ease the situation on the Korean Peninsula, denuclearize the Peninsula and politically resolve the Korean Peninsula issue. Achieving the denuclearization of the Peninsula and lasting peace of the region serves the common interests of the people on the Peninsula and of the region and meets the shared aspirations of the international community,\" Lu said in a statement.\n\n\"We hope that the DPRK will score achievements in developing its economy and improving people's livelihood. We support the DPRK and other relevant parties in addressing their respective concerns and improving their relations through dialogue and consultation.

China will continue with its positive role to this end,\" he added.\n\nJUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRussia too said it supported the decision, but said the U.S. should respond by cutting regional military drills considered provocative by North Korea. Russia initially controlled the northern half of the Korean Peninsula after splitting it with the U.S. after World War II, but soon gave the reigns to Kim's grandfather, who founded the notoriously secretive state, built an ideological blend of socialism and self-reliance that lives on today.\n\n\"We consider this decision as an important step towards further easing tension on the Korean Peninsula and consolidating positive trends towards normalizing the situation in Northeast Asia,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"We urge the U.S. and the Republic of Korea to take adequate counter-measures aimed at reducing military activity in the region and achieving mutually acceptable agreements with the DPRK at the upcoming inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korean summits,\" it added.\n\nThe statement said halting drills would be part of the \"double freeze\" approach developed jointly by Russia and China to solve the ongoing nuclear crisis. Russia and China both aim for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but are also deeply critical of growing U.S. presence in the Pacific and have enhanced their own bilateral political and military ties as they rebalance global influence.\n\nCNS NORTH KOREA MISSILE TEST DATABASE/NUCLEAR THREAT INITIATIVE/DAVID WRIGHT/GLOBAL SECURITY PROGRAM/UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS/REUTERS\n\nCNS NORTH KOREA MISSILE TEST DATABASE/NUCLEAR THREAT INITIATIVE/CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES/NORSAR/REUTERS\n\nThe U.S.'s two leading allies in the Pacific also weighed in.

The position was echoed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who recently met with Trump to discuss the North Korean issue.\n\n\"I want to welcome these positive moves, but I wonder if this will lead to the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal, weapons of mass destruction and missiles,\" Abe told reporters in Tokyo, according to The Japan Times. \"I\u2019d like to keep a close eye on the developments.\""}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-white-house-fears-of-rosenstein-dismissal-ease-1524338503", "title": "Inside the White House, Fears of Rosenstein Dismissal Ease", "text": "Last week, President Donald Trump\u2019s advisers believed he would soon fire the Justice Department official overseeing a Russia investigation he calls a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d a step that could set off a cascade of resignations and a potential crisis.\n\nBut in recent days a series of events have played out that have calmed the situation, easing fears that Mr. Trump would imminently move against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nIn..."}, {"link": "https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/we-urge-congregations-to-pray-for-peace-in-mahikeng-pastor-20180421", "title": "'We urge congregations to pray for peace in Mahikeng' - pastor", "text": "'We urge congregations to pray for peace in Mahikeng' - pastor\n\nCalm has returned to Mahikeng in the North West province following violent protests, with residents slowly picking up the pieces.

The GSMA was working with carriers, device makers, and SIM manufacturers worldwide on the standard.\n\nAT&T told Ars that it is cooperating with the DOJ investigation. \"We are aware of the investigation into GSMA's process for developing eSIM standards that provide a better experience for consumers,\" AT&T said. \"Along with other GSMA members, we have provided information to the government in response to their requests and will continue to work proactively within GSMA, including with those who might disagree with the proposed standards, to move this issue forward.\"\n\nArs contacted Apple and will update this story if we get a response.\n\nVerizon: This is \u201cmuch ado about nothing\u201d\n\nA Verizon spokesperson described the investigation as \"much ado about nothing,\" telling Ars that it boils down to \"a difference of opinion with a couple of phone-equipment manufacturers regarding the development of eSIM standards.\"\n\n\"We've been proactively and constructively working with the Department of Justice for several months regarding this inquiry, and we continue to do so,\" Verizon told Ars. \"As we have from the outset, we will continue to work with federal officials and others in the industry as we strive to find a mutually acceptable solution.\"\n\nVerizon told The Washington Post that \"The government looked at this issue once before. Their findings were quite clear then, and we're confident the outcome will be the same this time... the reality is that there's nothing to substantiate it.

No one else does.\"\n\nStandards-setting bodies like the GSMA are influential and \"create an opportunity for collusion\" for incumbent companies, Bergmayer said.\n\nThe DOJ hasn't confirmed the investigation publicly, but the Times said its report was based on information from \"six people with knowledge of the inquiry.\"\n\n\"In a private meeting of a task force called GSMA North America this year, AT&T and Verizon pushed for the ability to lock phones to their networks, bypassing the purpose of eSIM technology,\" the Times report said. \"Verizon has said it needed to be able to lock down phones to prevent theft and fraud.\"\n\nDOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said in a speech this month that the department is concerned about \"collusive conduct\" in the context of standard setting.

Whether arising out of religious beliefs (e.g. that all persons are made in the image of God) or from the work of philosophers like Immanuel Kant (all persons belong to the \"kingdom of ends\"), the idea runs deep that human beings possess intrinsic dignity \u2014 that can neither be earned nor diminished.\n\nIt is this concept of \"respect for persons\" that lies behind the prohibition of slavery \u2014 or any other practice that reduces a human being to the status of a mere tool to be exploited by others.\n\nYet, in recent years, there has been a growing sense of discontent \u2014 and this is despite a general increase in affluence across the developed world.\n\nIt used to be that the feeling of being marginalised was experienced by those who were literally on the margins of society.\n\nThe most egregious cases of deprivation, in Australia, have fallen on a significant number of Indigenous Australians \u2014 precisely because of a failure to acknowledge their fundamental equality.\n\nHowever, that unsettling feeling has been spreading.\n\n'Nation of equals' ideal losing credibility\n\nMy sense is that a growing number of Australians feel that the mythic ideal of Australia as a nation of equals is losing all credibility.\n\nThey are angry. They are disappointed. They are vengeful. Above all, they are fearful that the nation's underlying \"social compact\" could have been so carelessly broken \u2014 and that the presumption in favour of basic equality has been replaced by indifference to a widening gap between: city and country, \"elites\" and ordinary folk, the \"haves\" and \"have nots\", the \"political class\" \u2026 and just about everyone else.\n\nIn essence, a very large number of people have come to feel they are just cogs in a machine \u2014 counting for nothing more than their capacity to work and vote.\n\nThey feel they serve a system that is indifferent to their hopes and interests \u2014 and that will exploit and discard them at will.\n\nThey feel robbed of their intrinsic dignity \u2014 and the basic equality that is their due.\n\nThe Committee for Economic Development of Australia's (CEDA) latest research report, How unequal? Insights on inequality, turns the spotlight on this dimension of contemporary life. It provides a factual account of the extent of the problem \u2014 along with analysis and recommendations for addressing the underlying issues.\n\nMy contribution to the report has been to provide a philosophical underpinning to the discussion of inequality.\n\nBut beyond this, I have tried to show how the current situation is at odds with the intentions of philosophers like Adam Smith, who established the intellectual foundations for market economics.\n\nOpportunity not merit-based, but 'accident of birth'\n\nEconomics as a discipline \u2014 and the market as a tool \u2014 were originally conceived of as means for increasing the stock of common good. Smith had no time for a kind of dog-eat-dog, let-it-rip economy. He championed a free market that depended on the maintenance of solid ethical foundations.\n\nHe denied the legitimacy of those who lie, cheat or use power oppressively because all such vices distort the market.\n\nFurthermore, the market was supposed to be an arena in which all could transact as equals \u2014 not in terms of outcome but in terms of opportunity.\n\nDespite this idea being written into competition legislation, we seem to be a long way from realising Smith's ethical ideal.\n\nTechnically, the market is \"open\" and \"free\". In reality, too many people are denied the basics in education, health, civic infrastructure, etc. to be on a genuinely equal footing.\n\nWorse still, the lack of opportunity, for some, has nothing to do with merit \u2014 but everything to do with mere accidents of birth.\n\nWe can and should do better. We should reform markets \u2014 and our democratic politics \u2014 to realise their original purposes as arenas in which all are fundamentally equal.\n\nDr Simon Longstaff is executive director of The Ethics Centre.\n\nTopics: poverty, economic-and-social-development, work, society, australia\n\nFirst posted"}, {"link": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-22/engineers-develop-ways-to-prevent-crash-sign-spearing/9681844", "title": "Safer road signs aim to prevent 'sign-spearing' in car crashes", "text": "Safer road signs designed to reduce risk of signs 'spearing' into windscreens in car crashes\n\nPosted\n\nEngineer John Spathonis knew he had to act when he saw a photo of a fatal car crash in which a road sign had pierced the vehicle's windscreen.\n\nA 29-year-old woman had died in the crash near Townsville in north Queensland in 2014.\n\nMr Spathonis said he and his colleagues at the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads started looking at the occurrence of deaths from what's known as \"sign-spearing\" \u2014 when a road sign penetrates a car's windscreen upon impact during a crash.\n\n\"Our records indicate that we've had three fatalities [involving sign-spearing] in recent years and another serious accident.

point.\n\nThe central Queensland cattle breeder acquired a brain injury 18 years ago when he fell off his horse while mustering, leaving him unable to walk or use the right side of his body.\n\n\"I was unconscious for eight weeks and in hospital for 10 months and when I woke, I thought it was the next morning and I thought, 'Where the bloody hell am I?',\" Mr Ingram recalled.\n\n\"I tried to

physiotherapist.\n\nThe physiotherapist put him in touch with the head coach at the gym, Glenn Hansen, who embarked on the journey to have Mr Ingram stand and walk without an aid.\n\n\"I was in a wheelchair and they said I would never walk again, but here I am walking,\" Mr Ingram said.\n\n\"I wish I had met Glenn 15 years ago.\"\n\nMr Ingram makes the 250 kilometre round trip from his property in Duaringa to Rockhampton twice a week to attend his gym sessions, and every couple of months he will come in five days a week.\n\nThese two-hour sessions are made up of repetitive exercises \u2014 lifting his legs, squeezing a ball \u2014 and it is hard work.\n\nHis speech has improved dramatically and he is able to stand and walk short distances unassisted.\n\n\"I am just like a little kid walking.\"\n\nThe changes are more than physical \u2014 they have opened up another world to Mr Ingram.\n\n\"I get to meet a lot of lovely people and that's the biggest thing I've found,\" he said.\n\nAfter Mr Ingram had his accident, he returned to his family home in Alpha in western Queensland, where he was isolated and had no communication.\n\nHe bought his Duaringa property three years ago, which has put him in better contact with the outside world and made this rehabilitation possible.\n\n\"I used to be very talkative, and then I became not so talkative and it's helped me come back.\"\n\nStanding among his cattle on his property is a remarkable achievement, but Mr Ingram is not going to stop there.\n\nHe has an ambitious goal.\n\n\"I will walk into the Droughtmaster judging

events.\n\nMeasuring the progress\n\nThere is no doubt in Mr Hansen's mind that Mr Ingram will be walking up a set of stairs onto the stage at Beef 2018.\n\n\"I said, 'right, you're going to walk 20 metres up onto that stage and away you go and you're going to do that without any walking aids',\" Mr Hansen said.\n\n\"And that has probably sparked him and that's what's created this push in the last six to eight weeks because he can see it's going to happen \u2014 he knows it's going to happen,\" Mr Hansen said.\n\nMr Ingram walked more than 100 metres during a recent session and although that might not sound like much, it used to take him 20 minutes to walk 30 metres.\n\n\"Now he can get there in seven minutes and it looks good,\" Mr Hansen said.\n\nThe challenge has been having Mr Ingram see his progress and knowing the limitations.\n\n\"Brain injuries can be very challenging because it's not like having a broken leg, where you can see the progress,\" Mr Hansen said.\n\n\"He tries really hard, he never gives in and he tries too hard sometimes and that's just born into the fact that it's just hard work.\"\n\n\"I think the one word I would use to describe Michael is inspirational.\n\n\"I would almost 99 per cent guarantee most people have not faced a challenge as great as he is facing right now.\"\n\n\"The lesson to take away from this story is to appreciate what

made a huge difference \u2014 they came here when I first came here and we've grown up together,\" Mr Ingram said.\n\nThe couple, who spent years travelling around the country as caretakers on people's properties, first met Mr Ingram five years ago.\n\nWhile the Bells note the physical changes, one of the biggest changes has been Mr Ingram's mental health. Ms Bell puts it down to the fact he is now meeting younger people in Rockhampton.\n\n\"Not just two oldies like us \u2014 it's a much better environment for him,\" Ms Bell said.\n\nBefore, he was welded to his phone and rarely ventured out of the house.\n\n\"He was inclined to be a bit depressed,\" Ms Bell said.\n\nNow Mr Ingram has built into his gym routine going out for coffee and meeting up with his daughter and son, who are in boarding school.\n\nHe is also more involved with work and will ride a four-wheeler to muster and help in the cattle yards, although Mr Bell does most of the outside work.\n\n\"Michael can stand on his own and look at his cattle, and he couldn't do that eight months ago,\" Mr Bell said.\n\n\"He would fall over.\"\n\nEven on the morning the ABC visited, Mr Ingram was out fencing, something he would not have done a year before.\n\n\"We went and fixed up a fence where we were straining a few posts and putting a few extra wires in \u2026 and I wanted Michael to come down and give me a hand,\" Mr Bell said.\n\n\"It probably took him twice as long, but I want him to get outside.\n\n\"Before, he wouldn't come out of the house and he'd be on his phone,\" Mr Bell laughed.\n\nMr Ingram's next goal is to attend the Droughtmaster National Bull Sale in Gracemere in September, where he will sell bulls from his newly established stud.\n\nTopics: community-and-society, carers, workplace, brain-and-nervous-system, rehabilitation, duaringa-4712, rockhampton-city-4700"}, {"link": "http://ew.com/tv/2018/04/21/westworld-thandie-newton-equal-pay/", "title": "<em>Westworld</em>'s Thandie Newton also getting equal pay: 'It's really exciting'", "text": "Thandie Newton confirmed that she, too, will be making the same money as her male costars on Westworld, days after Evan Rachel Wood said HBO rectified her own pay disparity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all happening right now, and yeah, we\u2019re all equal across the board,\u201d Newton told Vanity Fair at the drama\u2019s season 2 premiere in New York, speaking about contract negotiations. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting.

This review comes from the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find funding, distribution, or even an audience for short films these days. Anyone can shoot a short and put it up online, and the competition from amateurs and free content is brisk enough to make any professional think twice about making a short for any reason except inspiration or fun. But for first-time filmmakers proving their talents, a well-received short film can open some doors and make funding for a feature easier to find. It worked for Neill Blomkamp, whose debut District 9 started as a short called Alive In Joburg. It worked for Damien Chazelle, who initially made Whiplash as a short proof-of-concept film, complete with J.K. Simmons playing the role that would win him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the feature-length version of the story. More recently, it worked for the directors of Prospect, which started out as a short film and recently became a terrific full-length that\u2019s still touring festivals.\n\nBut the downside to turning a well-received short into a feature is that if the short has enough pass-around value to go viral online, viewers who eventually see the feature-length version may compare the two unfavorably. That\u2019s a problem for Yolanda Ramke and Ben Howling\u2019s new Netflix movie Cargo, a zombie feature that expands on their hit 2013 short of the same name. The short version is memorable, effective, and tremendously efficient, telling an emotional little horror story in just over seven minutes, credits included. The 105-minute feature version eventually arrives at a similar conclusion, but the extra material doesn\u2019t necessarily add that much to the story. For people who\u2019ve seen the short, the long version can feel like it\u2019s just marking time, stretching out the narrative until it\u2019s time for the familiar punch. (So be warned, the short is linked above, but watching it will basically spoil the full-length movie.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the genre?\n\nZombie survival horror. The film has a few new twists on the genre \u2014 among other things, it doesn\u2019t feel particularly political, or like a commentary on humanity. Inevitably, it has a character who\u2019s more of a monster than the zombies are, but that isn\u2019t specifically the point of the story.\n\nWhat\u2019s it about?\n\nAndy (Martin Freeman) and Kay (Susie Porter) are a couple navigating a zombie outbreak in the Australian interior. As the film opens, they\u2019ve clearly been through some trauma, but they\u2019ve commandeered a houseboat where they\u2019re keeping their infant daughter Rosie safe. They don\u2019t agree about where to go next \u2014 Andy wants to stick to the river and head for a military base, Kay points out that they\u2019re out of supplies and need to head overland to restock \u2014 but everything about their relationship suggests quiet devotion and dedication. Then a series of incidents leaves Andy traveling alone overland with Rosie strapped to his back, trying to dodge infected attackers and find a safe haven in spite of a ticking clock.\n\nMeanwhile, a young Aboriginal woman named Thoomi (Simone Landers) is in the opposite position, trying to protect her infected father, who she can mostly control by feeding him wildlife, keeping him gagged, and keeping a close watch on him. But her community is actively hunting and eliminating the zombies, so she\u2019s isolated herself from them In the early going of Cargo, the story periodically finds her for short blinks, tracking what she\u2019s up to. Then she and Andy start crossing each other\u2019s paths, and changing each other\u2019s story.\n\nWhat\u2019s it really about?\n\nHuman connection. In this story, they\u2019re mostly of the familial kind, and mostly about the responsibility spouses owe each other, or children and parents owe each other. But somewhat inevitably for a zombie story, Cargo becomes a movie about found family, and how it can be poisonous or crucial, depending on the people involved and their willingness to harm or help each other to further their own goals.\n\nIs it good?\n\nAt this point, there have been so many zombie stories that one of the primary markers of quality in any new canon entry is whether it has anything new to say, or finds any new spins on the genre. Ramke, who scripted both the short and the feature, has a few fresh ideas. For one, she doesn\u2019t give her zombies a name \u2014 Andy and Kay don\u2019t even refer to the walking-dead issue, they just talk practical strategies, which feels like something parents might do out of instinct, and also feels a lot more natural than trading exposition. For another, Ramke\u2019s zombies seek dark places to hibernate, which often includes literally burying their heads in the dirt to shut out the light. For a third, the stages of this particular outbreak include producing an immense amount of resinous, amber-colored goop from the eyes and mouth, which saves a lot of rotting-face makeup effects, while still producing a startling and distinctive look.\n\nBut these are largely cosmetic effects. (In the case of the face-goop, literally so.) And a great deal of Cargo is extremely familiar \u2014 dodging the shambling undead, dealing with bites and the progression of the disease, watching other people with a wary mixture of need and distrust. A more significant difference is how much time Cargo spends with people who are calmly contemplating their own suicide, and sometimes carrying it out. In Ramke\u2019s world, the Australian government is still active enough to bombard the outback with infection kits, which include wrist restraints, a bite guard, a map of known infected areas, a simple watch with a 48-hour countdown (from first bite to full-blown monsterism)\u2026 and a simple, effective suicide device. Given how many zombie stories are basically elaborate wish-fulfillment video games, about blowing away targets, hoarding supplies, and finding a safe spot, Cargo\u2019s quiet acknowledgement that suicide might be a kind option for the infected feels revelatory and even dangerous.\n\nAnd the film gets plenty of pathos out of Andy\u2019s relationship with Rosie, a generally sweet and tractable kid who\u2019s too young to understand any of what\u2019s going on, but not too young to respond warmly to displays of affection. (Four different babies played Rosie, so it\u2019s impossible for a casual viewer to know which one\u2019s in a given scene, but Ramke and Howling capture a couple of moments between Andy and Rosie that are downright magical, all the more so for knowing they\u2019re spontaneous and undirected. Much as John Krasinski\u2019s recent horror hit A Quiet Place draws on the profound vulnerability of a newborn in a monster-filled world, Cargo makes it constantly clear that Rosie\u2019s life hangs on Andy\u2019s choices, in a situation where those choices are vanishingly few.\n\nFreeman isn\u2019t the most emotionally expressive actor out there. He has a certain range, and projects from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy to The Office to Peter Jackson\u2019s Hobbit trilogy to Black Panther have made use of his notable talent for playing brittle, fussy, endlessly put-upon characters. But while he\u2019s solid at expressing shock and concern, he tends to bring across most other emotions with a tight, distant smile or mild frown that expresses a layer of resignation above everything else he might be feeling. That approach mostly actually works well here, as he plays a man who\u2019s tamped down all his emotional responses as he tries to project confidence and cheeriness for his family.\n\nBut occasionally, it doesn\u2019t seem like enough. Cargo\u2019s biggest flaw is that it feels too even-keeled and mild to give viewers the proper sense of alarm or desperation. And to some degree, that feels like an artifact of it coming out of a short film that covered the most necessary bases of the story. The directors spend long stretches of Cargo on characters tramping around the outback, or surveying their surroundings, or otherwise standing still. Andy meets characters who don\u2019t add much to the story, or spends too much time engaged with crucial characters who don\u2019t express much nuance. The pacing is meant to be quiet and thoughtful, but that means it sometimes drags. It\u2019s easy to feel that the directors are going for a sort of elegiac Australian end-of-the-world story like On The Beach, or a poetic outback story like Walkabout, but the tone doesn\u2019t provide the sense of urgency the story is meant to have.\n\nAnd Thoomi and her side story do add to the narrative, but not everything they add is positive. She seems to live in a parallel world that has nothing to do with Andy\u2019s understanding of reality, and the mild sense of magical realism her people bring to the story sometimes feels a bit suspect, like yet another case of treating native tribes as mystics and noble savages. The presence of 40-year Australian film stalwart David Gulpilil as the \u201cclever man\u201d of Thoomi\u2019s tribe is a grounding element, but he\u2019s not really allowed to be a character, so much as he is a symbol. Thoomi and Andy become important to each other, but neither really understands or connects with the other in any but the shallowest ways, and the way she feels like a plot device more than an integral part of the story is a significant flaw. That\u2019s the problem with turning a strong short into an entire feature \u2014 not every element is going to seem necessary to the new version, since it wasn\u2019t necessary for the old one. Possibly everyone is better off just picking one version or the other to watch, and sticking with that.\n\nWhat should it be rated?\n\nThere\u2019s certainly blood and gore, but it\u2019s fairly brief and toned-down for a zombie movie. PG-13 at worst.\n\nHow can I actually watch it?\n\nCargo will launch on Netflix on May 18th in America."}, {"link": "https://www.axios.com/2018-midterms-democratic-house-leadership-9154ff96-6fdf-43d0-95c3-5e0f9ee3e3f8.html?utm_source=sidebar", "title": "Clyburn: Democratic leadership has \"got to go\" if midterms fail", "text": "Rep.

These have stalls festooned with trendy-looking clothes, often sporting surprisingly familiar global labels. India\u2019s \u2018export surplus\u2019 markets \u2014 or, to be more accurate, \u2018export reject\u2019 markets \u2014 have been ensuring that youngsters (as well as the hard-working poor and the ever-thrifty middle class) can actually buy fashionable clothes at pocket-friendly prices.\n\nBut these markets are only a side note to the real story. India\u2019s huge $100 billion-plus textiles and apparels industry, which employs more than 45 million people, accounts for almost 14% of exports and over a quarter of foreign exchange earnings. It is the second-largest employment sector after agriculture. Of this, the apparel sector alone accounts for more than 12 million jobs and a chunk of the exports.\n\nAlarming data\n\nHowever, all that may soon become a thing of the past. Not that India\u2019s apparel sector is going away or anything \u2014 a nation of 1.3 billion people needs a lot of clothes \u2014 but India is quickly losing its place at the top of the table of apparel-exporting nations.\n\nLast week, some alarming confirmation of this came by way of official export data, which went by somewhat unnoticed amidst the incidents of rape and a widespread shortage of cash which sparked nightmare flashbacks of demonetisation and sent people scurrying to ATMs to hoard more cash and worsen the situation.\n\nApparel exports in February (the latest month for which data are available) stood at $1.44 billion, a decline of 10.25% compared to the year before. In fiscal 2017-18 (April to February), overall apparel production declined 10.4% , while garment exports fell 4%. Worse, the trend is clearly downwards. Garment exports have fallen for six months in a row now and, except for a spike in a couple of months, have been mostly negative.\n\nThere are no signs of any immediate turnaround. The sector got hit with a double whammy: demonetisation and the goods and services tax (GST). Meanwhile, the rupee has also been appreciating, gaining 6.4% against the dollar through 2017. This means that an exporter who quoted, say, \u20b9100 per piece last April and quotes the same rate this April is already 6% more expensive to his buyer.\n\nAnd the industry simply does not have the margin to take this 6% hit and still stay competitive with countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam which are eyeing India\u2019s already shrinking share of the pie. Apparel exports from Bangladesh crossed India\u2019s in 2003, while Vietnam passed India in 2011. Both nations enjoy the same advantage that India does \u2014 an abundance of cheap, skilled labour. In addition, they also enjoy favoured access through treaties to major markets like the U.S. and the European Union, while India is under intense pressure from the World Trade Organisation to phase out subsidies and incentives given to the textiles sector as the sector has already achieved \u2018export competitiveness\u2019.\n\nThe trouble is that while India\u2019s garments sector is large in the aggregate, it is comprised mostly of tiny units. Almost 90% of India\u2019s garment manufacturing units are in the unregistered sector. About 78% of the firms employ less than 50 workers and only 10% more than 500 workers. This means that individual entrepreneurs have severe limitations on the kind of capital they can invest in capacity and technology. So, most Indian garment exporters tend to compete at the bottom end of the market where competition is toughest.\n\nOther challenges\n\nWith margins already wafer-thin, exporters also have to struggle with other challenges of doing business in India. For example, the Economic Survey 2016-17 made a strong case for focusing on the textiles and apparels sector as a job creator. Apparels are 80 times more labour-intensive than automobiles and create 240-fold more jobs than steel, the Survey pointed out. The Chief Economic Adviser\u2019s team also highlighted the key issues: \u201cLogistics, labour regulations, and tax and tariff policy, and disadvantages emanating from the international trading environment compared to competitor countries.\u201d In other words, trade treaties.\n\nLogistics costs are also high: around $7/km by road transport, while it is just $2.5/km in China and $3/km in Sri Lanka. Add onerous tax issues and huge difficulties in even claiming one\u2019s legitimate dues. The biggest impact of GST has been that refunds due to exporters have been stuck for months, leading to locking up of working capital.\n\nWhat this needs is a holistic policy response rather than temporary band-aids and piecemeal incentives. The tax policy needs to be aligned with global trends, while the scale problem needs to be met through aggregation of individual units in large clusters, preferably with quick access to export points, thus curbing logistics costs. Technology upgradation needs serious funding, while trade treaties need to be reviewed to ensure that India gets access for its competitive products in major markets. Above all, Indian entrepreneurs need to also focus on creating their own global brands rather than simply producing for other labels."}, {"link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_water_vortex_power_plant", "title": "Gravitation water vortex power plant", "text": "A schematic presentation of a gravitation water vortex power plant, showing the turbine in yellow\n\nThe gravitation water vortex power plant is a type of micro hydro vortex turbine system which is capable of producing energy using a low hydraulic head of 0.7\u20133 metres (2 ft 4 in\u20139 ft 10 in). The technology is based on a round basin with a central drain.

On one hand its part of the EMC federation companies that Dell acquired in 2016 for a cool $67 billion, but it\u2019s also an independently operated entity within that broader Dell family of companies \u2014 and that has to be a fine line to walk.\n\nWhatever the challenges, the company went public yesterday and joined VMware as a separately traded company within Dell. CEO Rob Mee says the company took the step of IPOing because it wanted additional capital.\n\n\u201cI think we can definitely use the capital to invest in marketing and R&D. The wider technology ecosystem is moving quickly. It does take additional investment to keep up,\u201d Mee told TechCrunch just a few hours after his company rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAs for that relationship of being a Dell company, he said that Michael Dell let him know early on after the EMC acquisition that he understood the company\u2019s position. \u201cFrom the time Dell acquired EMC, Michael was clear with me: You run the company. I\u2019m just here to help. Dell is our largest shareholder, but we run independently. There have been opportunities to test that [since the acquisition] and it has held true,\u201d Mee said.\n\nMee says that independence is essential because Pivotal has to remain technology-agnostic and it can\u2019t favor Dell products and services over that mission. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary because our core product is a cloud-agnostic platform. Our core value proposition is independence from any provider \u2014 and Dell and VMware are infrastructure providers,\u201d he said.\n\nThat said, Mee also can play both sides because he can build products and services that do align with Dell and VMware offerings. \u201cCertainly the companies inside the Dell family are customers of ours. Michael Dell has encouraged the IT group to adopt our methods and they are doing so,\u201d he said. They have also started working more closely with VMware, announcing a container partnership last year.\n\nOverall though he sees his company\u2019s mission in much broader terms, doing nothing less than helping the world\u2019s largest companies transform their organizations. \u201cOur mission is to transform how the world builds software. We are focused on the largest organizations in the world. What is a tailwind for us is that the reality is these large companies are at a tipping point of adopting how they digitize and develop software for strategic advantage,\u201d Mee said.\n\nThe stock closed up 5 percent last night, but Mee says this isn\u2019t about a single day. \u201cWe do very much focus on the long term. We have been executing to a quarterly cadence and have behaved like a public company inside Pivotal [even before the IPO].

Instead, that honor goes to countless production pages, all revealing original pencil lines, ink traces, white-outs, and color-request markings.\n\n\"Without private collectors, we wouldn't have a show,\" curator Benjamin Saunders frankly admitted to Ars, as pretty much every piece has a collector's name attached. When pressed, Saunders pointed to longtime writer and producer David Mandel (Veep, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld) as the exhibit's largest contributor. The collection's main exception is the first-ever appearance of Spider-man on a comic page, on loan from the Library of Congress for only three months. (\"I shudder to think of the insurance value,\" Saunders notes about that page.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is not a true \"how Marvel came to be\" exhibit, and its pickier selection of movie and TV tie-ins make that abundantly clear. You have to walk downstairs to a \"street-level\" section of the exhibit to find any tributes to the X-Men, for starters, and none of that comic's films or animated series receive any acknowledgement. Same for any Sony Pictures films, particularly the Tobey Maguire trilogy of Spider-man films. (The utter lack of Deadpool comic or film material, on the heels of its sequel's impending launch, feels particularly weird.)\n\n\"I wanted to emphasize the story of comics to the screen and back again,\" Saunders said when pressed on the selection. \"We had access to Marvel's entire print library\u2014anything from that was fair game\u2014and we could use that to pay the right tribute to the Fantastic Four and X-Men, which have more tangled rights histories.\"\n\nFurther Reading Rube Goldberg museum exhibit reminds us why his name is in the dictionary But Marvel's tangled history as a comics publisher (under different names) from the '30s to '60s and its network of affiliated creators and artists don't get a museum-level historical dive or explanation, with the exception of a few touchscreen interfaces that let visitors get to know some of the company's biggest names a little better. Also, the exhibit's biggest historical beats are defined by which MCU properties the exhibit can highlight with props and film costumes. The result is ultimately two things at the same time: a shameless advertisement for Marvel Studios' film and TV output; and a must-see dive into some of the rarest, decades-old Marvel material imaginable.\n\nThe result isn't perfect, but comic-clueless novices and obsessive collectors will each get something out of what Marvel Entertainment has delivered. No closing date has been announced, though the exhibit's official descriptions hint that it should run well into Marvel's official 80th anniversary in 2019.\n\nListing image by Sam Machkovech"}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43852822", "title": "President tries personal touch at protest", "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New President Armen Sargsyan walks into the crowd in the hopes of defusing protests\n\nThe new president of Armenia has intervened personally with opposition supporters protesting at his predecessor's attempts to retain power.\n\nArmen Sargsyan walked up to the leader of the protests in the capital Yerevan to shake hands and chat briefly, apparently to propose formal talks.\n\nUnrest has gripped the republic in the Caucasus Mountains for nine days.\n\nSerzh Sargsyan (no relation) stepped down as president but returned as prime minister, breaking his own promise.\n\nWhile he was president, the country shifted from a presidential system to a parliamentary republic, vesting real power in the office of the prime minister.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Riot police have been holding back the protesters\n\nRiot police have been facing off with crowds of demonstrators for days and scuffles have broken out, with a number of arrests.\n\nMany Armenians want to see genuine change in their country but they feel that they are being deprived of that opportunity because the leadership remains the same, the BBC's Rayhan Demytrie reports.\n\nThe small landlocked country, population 3.1 million, saw an economic recovery last year, the World Bank reports.\n\nHowever, it is vulnerable to developments in Russia, its biggest trading partner after the EU and a major destination for its migrant workers.\n\nWhat happened in the crowd?\n\nThe president approached protest leader Nikol Pashinyan on Republic Square, removing his tie as he did so, apparently to emphasise it was an informal meeting.\n\nThey talked for about 10 minutes, reporters say, with Mr Sargsyan suggesting they move to a hotel to hold proper negotiations.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Nikol Pashinyan has called for a \"velvet revolution\"\n\nMr Pashinyan declined the offer of immediate talks but asked for a guarantee that force would not be used against the demonstrators.\n\nEscorted by his bodyguards, the president then walked back to his car and left as the crowd chanted \"take a step - overthrow Serzh\".\n\nMr Pashinyan later announced he would meet Serzh Sargsyan at hotel on Sunday morning.

The date is mourned by Palestinians as their \u201cnakba\u201d, or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands were uprooted from their homes."}, {"link": "http://www.thesportbible.com/football/news-jadon-sancho-well-and-truly-arrived-in-the-bundesliga-today-20180421", "title": "Jadon Sancho Well And Truly Arrived In The Bundesliga Today", "text": "Today was the day that Englishman Jadon Sancho well and truly made his mark in Germany.\n\nThe wonderkid made a surprise decision when he left Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund in the summer despite being extremely highly-rated by Pep Guardiola and the club on the whole.\n\nBut when the 18-year old was handed the No.7 shirt previously worn by Ousmane Dembele by Dortmund, it was clear that they had high hopes for him and he would have a better chance of making the grade.\n\nAnd his decision looks to have been justified today as he starred in a 4-0 thrashing over Bayer Leverkusen.\n\n\n\nImage: PA\n\n\n\nThe Under 17-World Cup opened the scoring with what his first ever senior goal, becoming the youngest Englishman to score in the Bundesliga in the process.\n\nThe former Watford youngster was brimming with joy over reaching such an important milestone but he didn't rest on his laurels from then on.\n\n18-year-old Jadon Sancho scores the first senior goal of his career :soccer:\n\n\n\nLook at what it means to him!\n\n\n\nDortmund 1-0 Leverkusen live on BT Sport 1 HD now :tv: pic.twitter.com/6oyQBgcjSV\n\n- Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 21, 2018\n\nSancho registered two assists in the comfortable win, including setting up Maximilian Philipp's goal with a filthy touch to bring the ball down, and then a wonderfully weighted pass.\n\nJadon Sancho :fire::scream:\n\n\n\nThe young Englishman sets up Dortmund's third with an outrageous touch.\n\n\n\nWhat a prospect he looks :raised_hands: pic.twitter.com/R3yjUbLlmT\n\n- Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 21, 2018\n\nIt was only the fourth time he has completed 90 minutes for Dortmund's first-teamers but you'd think he'll keep his place from now until the end of the season.\n\nOne of the most exciting English talents around, he is well worth keeping tabs on."}, {"link": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/after-air-accidents-survivors-grapple-flying-again-n868086", "title": "After air accidents, survivors grapple with flying again", "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nHundreds of hands grappling with oxygen masks. Flight attendants warning passengers to brace for impact. The plane hurtling toward the unforgiving ground.\n\nSurvivors of air accidents often proclaim that their survival was a miracle. But what follows is another kind of miracle: Many survivors manage to get past the horror and onto planes again.\n\nHow do they do it?\n\nIt\u2019s a question facing survivors of this week\u2019s Southwest Airlines accident, which killed one woman who was sucked partway out of the plane after the engine exploded and shattered a window.\n\nAuthorities said 148 passengers walked away, underscoring an important point: Plane crashes are rare, but when they happen, people often survive them. Between 1983 and 2000, 95.7 percent of people involved in commercial airline accidents survived, according to government data. In 2013, 304 of the 307 passengers survived an Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco. And the horrific 1989 crash of a United Airlines flight in Sioux City, Iowa, had 185 survivors.\n\nFor guidance, survivors of Southwest Flight 1380 might look to those others who have survived air disasters. Some of them say it\u2019s critical to get back in the air quickly; they suggest counseling, prayer and even calming apps. But others never get over the fear.\n\nA Southwest Airlines plane sits on the runway at the Philadelphia International Airport after it made an emergency landing in Philadelphia on April 17, 2018. David Maialetti / AP\n\nDave Sanderson was the last passenger to exit US Airways Flight 1549 after its emergency landing in the Hudson River in January 2009. He spent one night recovering from hypothermia at a New York hospital. The next day he had to make a decision: Could he fly back home to North Carolina?\n\nSanderson steeled himself; flying was the fastest way home. When he arrived at the gate, the captain and first officer got off the plane, listened to his story and reassured him. A flight attendant cleared a row of seats for him.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get back immediately, you may never get back on that plane,\u201d said Sanderson, who now travels around the country giving inspirational speeches.\n\nSanderson makes it a habit to talk to the crew when he boards a plane. He also learns about the plane, including the exit strategy and what kind of doors it has.\n\nOthers lean on faith. Helen Young Hayes survived the crash of United Flight 232 in Sioux City, which killed 111 people. Hayes, a lifelong Catholic, closed her eyes and prayed as the plane went down; later, as she recovered from her burns, she thought a lot about why her life was spared.\n\nHayes started flying again about two months after the crash, confident that God would hold her whatever the outcome of the flight. She has since flown more than 1 million miles.\n\n\u201cI would never have stepped on a plane again if I didn\u2019t firmly believe I had been totally saved by a miracle,\u201d said Hayes, who heads a Denver workforce development company that helps low-income people.\n\nHayes says survivors need to take time to heal. Their bodies will never forget, she says; every time she hits turbulence, she remembers what it felt like when the plane went down. But she also sees the crash as a gift that helped her find a higher purpose for her life.\n\nJennifer Stansberry Miller, a clinical social worker and crisis consultant, has been an advocate for survivors since her brother died in a plane crash in 1994. She says every survivor must find his or her own way. Some have trouble eating and sleeping and may need professional guidance. Others use apps that talk passengers through flying or forecast the amount of turbulence they might encounter.\n\nOthers take classes at airports that help people master their fears. Milwaukee\u2019s Mitchell Airport offers a $200, five-session class that culminates with a short commercial flight.\n\nRelated Firefighter on board fatal Southwest flight speaks on trying to save woman\n\nMiller has her own ways to fight fear. She won\u2019t travel on Halloween \u2014 the day her brother\u2019s plane crashed \u2014 or on major holidays, when she assumes the most experienced pilots aren\u2019t flying. She only flies on jets, not propeller planes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect science, but it\u2019s what I reconcile in my brain to fly,\u201d she said.\n\nSome survivors can\u2019t bring themselves to fly again. In 2008, drummer Travis Barker of the band Blink-182 was involved in a small plane crash that killed four of the six people aboard. Eight years later, when his band toured Europe, Barker was still unable to fly. He crossed the Atlantic on the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship.\n\nEric Zilbert, who was aboard Tuesday\u2019s Southwest flight, said the experience has been most difficult for his wife, who had to deal with the thought of almost losing him. On future flights, he says, he\u2019ll look more closely at the plane\u2019s equipment and choose seats in front of the wing.\n\nZilbert, a statistician, says he knows it\u2019s unlikely that another plane he boards will ever experience a similar emergency. He and his mother even flew home after the accident.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t sit by the window, and they were fine flights,\u201d he said."}, {"link": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/04/21/manchester-united-vs-tottenham-hotspur-player-ratings-shone/", "title": "Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur player ratings\u00a0\u2013 who shone and who wilted in FA Cup semi-final?", "text": "Manchester United (4-3-3)\n\nDavid de Gea\n\nThe Spaniard could not do anything about Dele\u2019s goal and did not have a significant save to make after picking the ball out of the net. 6/10\n\nAntonio Valencia\n\nPossibly lucky to escape with just a yellow card for his challenge on Dele and was later substituted as he risked being booked for a second time. 5/10\n\nChris Smalling\n\nThe central defender lost Dele for Tottenham\u2019s opening goal, but made up for it by blocking a second-half effort from Kane and ushering the ball out late on. 7/10\n\nPhil Jones\n\nJones marshalled Kane well and, as always, put his body on his line to keep the opposition out.

Manchester United and Jose Mourinho did what they\u2019ve done for most of their history by displaying the resilience to win a big game, Tottenham Hotspur and Mauricio Pochettino did what they\u2019ve done for most of theirs by showing such fragility to lose one.\n\nThe season won\u2019t now end with the Argentine winning his first trophy, but might well see Mourinho claim his third at United, as this 2-1 comeback sends them back to Wembley for the FA Cup final. They now look in the right kind of spirit to win it. They have the purpose, and have the conviction, as so perfectly displayed by the relentless Ander Herrera\u2019s brilliant match-winner.\n\nIt also means their season still has meaning, and could still be a real success, something that is now much more debatable for Spurs.\n\nThat was what this match was about as much a place back at Wembley for the final, and Spurs\u2019 history of underwhelming. For both clubs, it was about defying their recent histories and problems to give the season something tangible and positive beyond mere Champions League qualification, and to set the right tone for the future.\n\nDele Alli celebrates scoring Tottenham\u2019s opener (Getty Images)\n\nThat future now suddenly looks that bit better for United.\n\nMourinho was right. As he has repeatedly said over the past week, he knows how to win. Pochettino, meanwhile, was wrong. The Spurs manager had argued that winning the FA Cup \u201cwon\u2019t change our lives\u201d but failing to win it does change the perception of the campaign.\n\nConsider this: it is the first season under Pochettino that hasn\u2019t shown tangible and statistical improvement; that hasn\u2019t seen a step forward. That is why they really needed to win this FA Cup. There is suddenly a sense they are plateauing.\n\nPochettino might continue to argue that the FA Cup doesn\u2019t mean all that, but this was about more than the trophy. It should also be all the more frustrating because of how they plateaued in the game itself, given how brilliantly they started.\n\nHarry Kane gets on the ball (Getty Images)\n\nRather than carry it, though, it was United that showed them how to really get through such matches. They also showed something that is now becoming a very evident quality in this team: a proper, Mourinho-driven resilience.\n\nWins like this don\u2019t mean all the issues go away, and there is a question as to why it seems they need to go behind to get on the front foot, but no one can question them for what happens when they do go behind. There is a real fortitude here, one that was so impressive in this semi-final because of how under pressure they were.\n\nThrough that, the opening half-hour didn\u2019t just set the game, but also summed so many issues of their seasons.\n\nUnited had also started as flatly as the games against West Brom and Manchester City, with Spurs as pumped as in the wins over Chelsea and Mourinho\u2019s side. Pochettino\u2019s team were so dominant at that point that they could genuinely been out of sight within the first 20 minutes. They had that many chances, looked that dangerous.\n\nAlexis Sanchez celebrates scoring United\u2019s equaliser ( AFP /Getty Images)\n\nThe contrast became so conspicuous for the opening goal, and was particularly clear between the two playmakers. As Pogba bizarrely strolled back, Christian Eriksen ran onto a perfect Davdson Sanchez ball before offering a supreme delivery of his own. The power was matched by the precision, and was met by the purpose of Dele Alli.\n\nThrough that goal, and that opening 20 minutes, you could see why Mourinho has been so frustrated with this team; why it is said that executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is fully behind any decision he takes regarding the squad.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long, however, until you could also see why United are in second place in the league; why there is optimism about the Portuguese\u2019s regime.\n\nAnd this was the frustration for Spurs. They were levelling United \u2013 but it would only take one goal to go back level. It wasn\u2019t long coming. United \u2013 and especially Pogba \u2013 seemed to wake up. The French star\u2019s languidness suddenly became a virtue, but was now reinforced by proper muscle.\n\nAnder Herrera fires in United\u2019s winning strike (Getty)\n\nPogba simply brushed the oddly under-performing Mousa Dembele off the ball, before clipping a supreme cross of his own in for Sanchez. The Chilean took the chance brilliantly.\n\nThis was the frustration for Spurs, but also for United, since it was a show of what they \u2013 and Pogba \u2013 can do when they get their act together.\n\nIt didn\u2019t just bring United back into the game, though. It also brought their game back up to speed. They were now stifling Spurs, principally through winning most of the big 50-50s. There was real conviction to United now.\n\nAnd there certainly was to Herrera\u2019s finish. Although the selection of Michel Vorm may now come under question as the ball went under him, that was probably down to the purity of the strike.\n\nThere was none of that from Spurs, other than maybe from Eriksen or Heung-Min Son. Their impetus was always going to be ineffective, however, when Dembele and Harry Kane were so off their game.\n\nIt was difficult to know who was playing worse, but easy to see the negative effect on the side. It got to the point where Pochettino had no option but to remove Dembele for Victor Wanyama.\n\nThat was far too little far too late. It said much that Spurs hadn\u2019t created a single chance of note after the 25th minute.\n\nThey\u2019ve now squandered another chance of a trophy. United have shown them how it\u2019s done.\n\nFollow the Independent Sport on Instagram here, for all of the best images, videos and stories from around the sporting world."}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/aKlwFZGOcw4/barbara-bush-remembered-for-her-dignity-and-wit-at-houston-funeral-idUSKBN1HS04S", "title": "Barbara Bush remembered for her dignity and wit at Houston funeral", "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Former first lady Barbara Bush was remembered at her funeral on Saturday as a formidable but caring figure whose devotion to her family was matched only by her commitment to public service.\n\n\u201cShe was our teacher and role model in how to live a life of purpose and meaning,\u201d one of her four sons, former Florida governor and 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush, told the crowded Houston church.\n\nHe then drew laughs with a nod to Bush\u2019s famously sharp tongue: \u201cShe called her style a benevolent dictatorship, but honestly, it wasn\u2019t all that benevolent.\u201d\n\nSome 1,500 mourners, including governors, senators and former U.S. presidents, gathered at a televised but invitation-only service at the church to pay tribute to the matriarch of one of the country\u2019s most prominent political dynasties, who died on Tuesday at age 92.\n\nBush, the wife of the 41st president of the United States, George H.W.

Bush would write a letter to his wife on each wedding anniversary, Jeb Bush said, before reading aloud one such letter from 1994, a year after his father left the White House.\n\n\u201cI was very happy on that day in 1945, but I\u2019m even happier today,\u201d he read, as his 93-year-old father squeezed his eyes shut and wept. \u201cYou have given me joy that few men know ...

He had told the family that he had no plans to come home in April.\n\nHowever, Idrees told his unit in Bihar that he had emergency work at home and applied for 10 days\u2019 leave.\n\n\u201cHe came home on April 13.

To subscribe to the newsletter, click here.\n\nI\u2019m your host, Ezekiel Kweku, and today I\u2019m grilling two members of New York\u2019s politics team \u2014 Eric Levitz and Ed Kilgore \u2014 on the urban housing crisis and how progressives should think about it. Let\u2019s go.\n\nEzekiel: S.B. 827, a bill to require local government to accept dense developments near transit hubs and thereby reduce housing costs, died in committee in California. What\u2019s the headline reason why?\n\nEd: Is Jon not going to be in on this one, since he wrote the column that got all the attention?\n\nEzekiel: He has a deadline. Plus, since he\u2019s not here we can talk about him behind his back.\n\nEd: Ha ha. I think our next chat topic should be about Jon. Purely and simply.\n\nEzekiel: \u201cFisking Chait.\u201d\n\nEd: I want to ask him again publicly about \u201cDiary of a Dean-o-phobe.\u201d\n\nEric: These chats should all just be Maoist criticism sessions of the DI staff.\n\nEd: Anyway \u2014 the reason is that it was opposed by nearly every local government in California, plus tenants\u2019 advocates, plus Republicans. It was obviously a big idea that scared a lot of people.\n\nEric: Also, millennial renters aren\u2019t as politically organized/motivated about zoning issues as boomer homeowners, and YIMBY yuppies aren\u2019t a big enough counterweight.\n\nEd: Maybe, though the only visible supporters of the measure were Silicon Valley types, real estate developers, and some environmentalists. Renters\u2019 groups tended to be as hostile as anyone else. I don\u2019t think the politics on the ground in California quite matched the configuration of forces in the national debate it helped promote.\n\nEric: In my (limited) experience covering similar issues in New York, low-income tenants\u2019 associations often fiercely oppose upzoning out of an (often correct) belief that development in their neighborhoods will increase the value of real-estate in the area, and thus, in the long run, raise their rents, even as the new supply brings down rents in the metropolitan area as a whole. Does seem like new development would be in the material interests of middle/upper middle-class renters \u2014 especially those currently priced out of desirable urban centers and/or convenient locations within them. But that constituency doesn\u2019t seem all that mobilized.\n\nEzekiel: I think the data agrees with you, Eric, that renters act like hyperlocalized NIMBYs.\n\nEd: The chief sponsor of S.B. 827, State Senator Scott Wiener, made a late (too late) effort to bring not only tenants\u2019 groups but minority housing advocates generally around with amendments that prohibited demolition of existing low-income housing and required construction of new low-income housing.\n\nEzekiel: So is this a problem with no constituency for any particular solution?\n\nEd: Over all, Ezekiel, you may be right. \u201cHigh-density housing\u201d is an extremely popular idea with urban planners and some environmentalists. But it\u2019s not popular with all that many voters. And the problem, of course, is that the impact on housing prices is debatable, as we\u2019ve already mentioned. The more general idea of using the leverage of state government to overcome NIMBYism at the local level still has merit, even if this particular approach to it fails.\n\nEric: I think there are alternatives that would likely garner more popular support, but developer resistance, like creating community land trusts that preserve affordability by converting public land into cooperatively owned housing and/or expanding public/social housing.\n\nEd: Yeah, there are other ways to increase the affordable housing stock than killing height restrictions. But they may not have the environmental benefits of upzoning. As a resident of the central coast of California, I can vouch for the fact that development restrictions are really pervasive.\n\nEric: True.\n\nEzekiel: I can just imagine the anti-social housing ads. \u201cObamatowns.\u201d\n\nEd: Any sort of significant development plan usually requires a ballot initiative, and the impulse of homeowners is to vote \u201cno\u201d on everything. In this context, the fact that California Republicans are so powerless is a good thing. One of the two GOP candidates for governor of California opposes the whole idea of multifamily housing, saying Californians want a backyard. That\u2019s really constructive, eh?\n\nEric: Yeah, social housing would be heavy lift. But if current trends persist, the ranks of the housing insecure are going to grow so massive, the boundaries of political possibility just might move, at least in blue states. Alternatively, there might be some way for policymakers to redirect economic activity away from the handful of metropolitan areas where it\u2019s currently concentrating. That\u2019s not a subject I\u2019ve thought much about, but the regional inequalities created by current trends seem to create a whole host of political and social problems.\n\nEzekiel: I do think that\u2019s part of the problem, Ed \u2014 having a house is part of the middle-class American dream.\n\nEd: Yes, I understand. But it\u2019s also why we have sprawl. I\u2019m originally from Atlanta, where minimum lot sizes and weak development planning has created a monster of a metropolitan area, covering 29 counties.\n\nEzekiel: Absolutely. Jumping off of that point, Eric, about regional inequality \u2014 Kevin Drum suggested (in a column that I found mostly incoherent other than this point) that we should focus on building denser housing in midsize cities rather than urban metropolises like San Francisco that seems to me to be a recipe, in theory, at least, for reducing regional inequality.\n\nEd: That\u2019s tough in a state the size and complexity of California. You could argue that by insisting on building a high-speed rail stretch connecting Fresno and Bakersfield that probably won\u2019t be built anywhere else, the state is trying to address regional inequality. But it won\u2019t go far, literally. [That was an inside California joke, Ezekiel!]\n\nEzekiel: Ha ha.\n\nEric: It does seem like employers are favoring big cities over midsize ones, due to various network effects (like the abundance and thus affordability of flights into NYC, relative to Cincinnati; and of course, the concentration of skilled and unskilled labor in the big metros) I feel like the regional inequality problem is more about jobs than housing (which follows from the former).\n\nEd: I agree with Eric that housing is sometimes overemphasized in these discussions. In the end, it\u2019s all about money. But the disparities in housing costs between, say, L.A. and Houston are pretty shocking to people. I feel like the environmental aspects of this issue aren\u2019t getting quite the attention they deserve.\n\nEzekiel: Ha, that could apply to any topic in 2018.\n\nEric: Very true.\n\nEd: A combination of housing prices, the abandonment of national fuel efficiency standards, and very limited public transit mean that more sprawl could be really devastating environmentally. People want their single-family housing with a big backyard, and their big-ass SUV, and cleaner air.\n\nEzekiel: Good thing the environment is in very good shape and can take a hit!\n\nEric: Every man a king. Every fall a thousand-year storm."}, {"link": "http://www.thesportbible.com/football/news-the-wembley-stadium-twitter-account-produced-some-brilliant-tweets-20180421", "title": "The Wembley Stadium Twitter Account Produced Some Brilliant Tweets During FA Cup Semi-Final", "text": "Whoever was running things on the official Wembley Stadium Twitter account for the FA Cup semi-final was clearly having a whale of a time.\n\nIt all started off pretty standard with a goal graphic to mark Dele Alli's opening goal after the Englishman got on the end of a typically superb delivery from Christian Eriksen.\n\nBut then, following United equalising through Alexis Sanchez, who broke free in the box to head home Paul Pogba's perfect pick-out - everyone thought the admin had forgot to switch accounts with the following tweet:\n\nThat was an unbelievable cross tbf to the lad\n\n- Wembley Stadium (@wembleystadium) April 21, 2018\n\nthe admin has just finished his 10 hour bong rip\n\n- Samuel Owens (@samrhysowens) April 21, 2018\n\nAdmin is on a mad one\n\n- \u064b (@ffsMendy) April 21, 2018\n\nWhen you forget to switch accounts \u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n- Rhys Bish (@Footyrhys) April 21, 2018\n\nHaha when you forget to switch accounts\n\n- Cameron Wilson (@cam1wilson) April 21, 2018\n\nHowever, as per the admin - whoever he or she may be - it was an intentional act:\n\nCan confirm is was intentional.

Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more. Buzz60\n\nThis photo provided by Edmunds shows a 2016 Honda Pilot in the service lanes at Hardin Honda in Anaheim, Calif. The internet notwithstanding, salespeople still know ways to save money that may be hidden to you. The trick is getting a seller to use that insider knowledge for your benefit. The first step is simple: Be nice to your salesperson. Having a sales pro on your side is key to getting that special deal. (Photo: Dan Edmunds, AP)\n\nMost of us want a special deal when we're car shopping: a price that beats what our neighbor just got and, if we are lucky, one that's lower than our research says we should be able to get.\n\nThe good news is that it's not impossible to strike a much-better-than-average deal. The better news is that getting it doesn't require massive amounts of research, shopping or haggling.\n\nSometimes, the difference between a good and a great deal may simply come down to a few things that you tell your salesperson in the days leading up to your purchase. This does fly in the face of traditional car-shopping advice, which urges shoppers to withhold information or even lie to car dealers. (Indeed, there's an old dealership saying: \"Buyers are liars.\")\n\nHolding back might have made sense when car dealers had all the information about pricing, incentives and inventory, and shoppers had very little. With the facts and figures available to you at car-shopping sites, the imbalance has largely been corrected. That means you can afford to employ some candor when it will serve you.\n\nThe internet notwithstanding, salespeople still know ways to save money that may be hidden to you. The trick is getting a seller to use that insider knowledge for your benefit. And it can be done, probably more easily than you'd expect.\n\nMore: How will you spend your tax refund?

Having a sales pro on your side is key to getting that special deal. And if that salesperson isn't nice back, save these five time- and money-saving statements for someone worthy of your business:\n\n1. I'm ready to buy right now\n\nYou've done your research and you know the right price. If that means you're ready to drive a car off the lot immediately, say so. Few things motivate a salesperson quite like offering to do business right now. Sharing your eagerness will move you from average tire kicker to hot prospect. Hot prospects are the ones who get the best discounts.\n\n2. Here are the car features I need \u2014 no frills\n\nSome people buy a car because they're in love with it. Others just want utility. If you buy cars the way you buy refrigerators, let your salesperson know. There may be a clearance vehicle or a car with a hefty incentive that can do the same job and save you some cash.\n\n3. I have bad credit\n\nIt's not impossible to buy a car if you have bad credit. In fact, it's nearly as common to buy a car with bad credit as it is with good. But poor credit can limit your choices to vehicles that meet certain age, mileage and price limits. Letting your salesperson know your credit situation upfront can save you hours looking at cars for which you won't be approved.\n\nCLOSE New Kelley Blue Book data shows Americans are choosing new trucks over new sedans. USA TODAY\n\n4. I'm in love with this car\n\nMaybe you've heard that you can trick a car dealer into giving you a steep discount by acting uninterested in the vehicle you're considering. This advice doesn't work. Dealers know that most people don't spend hard-earned money on cars they don't like. In fact, this tactic may actually work against you. Car salespeople work hard to get stellar after-sales surveys and reviews. Their compensation may depend on it. It's difficult to get a five-star review from a shopper who isn't happy with the product.\n\nA more effective way to get a better deal is to let the seller know you're excited about the car. A happy buyer is one who will tell friends and family about the car, which may mean more customers, good comments on review sites, and good buzz on social media.\n\nIf you've done your research and know what you should pay, you're in little danger of being overcharged because you've told the dealership you really love the car you're planning to buy.\n\n5. Throw this in and we have a deal\n\nDuring big sales events, motivated dealerships sometimes give away iPads, televisions, cruises and even small fishing boats in hopes of spurring extra business.\n\nSimilarly, but on a smaller scale, a dealer may be willing to throw in a little something extra to close a deal, even it isn't a big sales weekend. If you've got your eye on an accessory from the parts department, such as a set of extra-tough floor mats, say so. If you want a few free services, such as oil changes, now's the time to ask.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Use your salesperson's insider knowledge to help you get a deal without hours of haggling and game-playing.\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

The impact punctured a three - foot hole into the hull and led to water seeping in.\n\nWhile there were no reports of injury, and the scientists were flown back to the Bharati station, one of those scientists \u2014 Subhajit Sen \u2014 was involved a month later in another, unrelated accident at India\u2019s second research station, Maitri, and succumbed to his injuries.

Ivan Papanin, a 28-year-old ice-breaker owned by Murmansk Shipping and frequently commissioned by India, suffered from a breach of this kind. \u201cIt struck an iceberg or some other underground structure and the scientists had to be evacuated by helicopter. Luckily, there wasn\u2019t an oil spill or else, even though we are using a Russian ship, India would have been guilty of polluting Antarctica and violating the Antarctica treaty,\u201d said M. Ravichandran, director, National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research, the Goa-based organisation charged with coordinating the annual exercise.\n\nAnother Russian ship had to be hurriedly arranged and the Indian scientists used it to continue on their expedition to base station Maitri, which is located about 100 km inland via a seven-day ship journey from Bharati.\n\nNormally, Indian scientists from several research institutions are selected every year to go in batches to Antarctica from November to March, the only clement months when ships and chartered flights can reach the continent \u2014 the ice being too thick other wise.\n\nThe late Mr. Sen, a student-scientist of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bhubaneswar, was injured on March 26 when he was helping unload a trailer, as big as a train coach and used to store cargo. One of the persons handling the trailer lost control of its brakes, crushing him. Though he was taken to the hospital aboard the ship and given emergency care, he did not survive. \u201cFew realise the hardship of working in Antarctica.

Kuldeep Wali, a 57- year-old meteorologist with the India Meteorological Department and part of India\u2019s 2008-9 expedition, died of a heart failure in June 2009 at Maitri. That\u2019s the period when impenetrable ice, and gales, prevent outgoing traffic. As a result, Wali had to be cremated at the station itself.\n\nInspite of regular expeditions to Antarctica, India doesn\u2019t yet have an ice-breaker ship of its own.

Even greatness cannot define what Boult did near the boundary ropes tonight.\n\nBrilliant catch by Trent Boult. Superb presence of mind to hold such a catch and not tip over the boundary. Outstanding. Kohli gutted by the dismissal to a full toss\n\nStunner. Stunner. Absolute stunner... That's you get the best batsman in the world out... Absolute ripper from Boult and even he didn't know how he took that much less Virat or anyone else...\n\nAfter 12 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 103/3 ( AB de Villiers 49 Anderson 2 , ) Rahul Tewatia is back on and instantly, Kohli's fall of wicket has made de Villiers a little cautious. Tewatis is getting odd bounce from the pitch as well. Is this Chinnaswamy really?\n\nFOUR! Walks across and then changes his mind and goes big over the covers. Boundary as a result and that's a fifty for him!\n\nThis is where Kohli and AB, mainly AB, scored their runs.\n\nSIX! Unreal, De Villiers sits and hits it over the backward square leg for a huge one. Phew!\n\nAfter 13 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 115/3 ( AB de Villiers 60 , Corey Anderson 3) Harshal Patel continues his third over and AB de Villiers continues his dominance in the game. He is playing with the bowlers rather than just playing them, hitting almost at will.\n\nSIX! Full in length and guess what de Villiers would do with it. Hit it for a maximum to deep mid-wicket.\n\nAfter 14 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 126/3 ( AB de Villiers 68 , Corey Anderson 6) Tewatia is back with his third over. The way de Villiers is playing it seems he is dealing with school kids here. Delhi takes a sigh of relief every time de Villiers takes a single. Match slipping out of visitors' hands if this carnage continues.\n\nSIX! Morris bowls a fullish one and this is foolish as well. De Villiers opens arm and goes straight, BANG, into the second tier of the stand\n\nFOUR! On the leg stump line and near hip region, cake walk for de Villiers as he guides it for a boundary.\n\nAfter 15 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 140/3 ( AB de Villiers 79 , Corey Anderson 8) Morris is back and Anderson doing the right thing, rotaing the stroke and giving more and more balls to de Villiers to play. The Protea is doing what he does best, punishing the bowler. RCB need 35 off 30 balls. This is a storm that has taken the Daredevilry out of Delhi.\n\nSIX! Full-toss to Anderson and he dispatches it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n\nMadness. Absolute madness. How do you bowl to AB de Villiers?! You don't. You give up if you are a bowler... Madness!\n\nABD has really set the stands on fire. Everytime he slams the ball to the fence the stadium rocks to the music of \"we will we will rock you\". Then cheers of ABD, ABD rents the air\n\nOUT! Clean Bowled as Trent Boult uproots the leg stump of Corey Anderson. Too late, it seems. Corey Anderson b Boult 15(13)\n\nAfter 16 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 149/4 ( AB de Villiers 80 , Mandeep Singh 1) Boult into the attack and he has bowled a high full-toss, which Anderson dispatched for a six. But he gets is revenge soon. Deja vu as RCB escaped another blunderous run-out and then lost a wicket. 26 needed off 24 balls. RCB should not worry here.\n\nSIX! Ball takes the top edge off Mandeep's bat and flies behind the keeper for a maximum.\n\nFOUR! Mandeep goes big this time, does not connect well, the ball bounces near the ropes and races away. Roy trying to stop it has injured himself.\n\nAfter 17 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 163/4 ( AB de Villiers 81 , Mandeep Singh 13) Gautam Gambhir looks stunned here and that is what de Villiers does to you. The shoulders of the Delhi players are down. Kohli's wicket was a booster of hope but de Villiers absolutely snatched this away from visitors. More trouble for Delhi as Roy has injured himself trying stop a boundary. Hope nothing is serious about the injury.\n\nLook at that upward curve, that is the difference ABD provides his side when he is mood.\n\nFOUR! Boult, round the wicket, pitches it short, angling into de Villiers, who ramps it for a boundary to third-man\n\nRCB win by 6 wickets. De villiers drives it for a beautiful boundary through the covers.\n\nAfter 18 overs,Royal Challengers Bangalore 176/4 ( AB de Villiers 90 , Mandeep Singh 17) That's a wrap for today from AB de Villiers who single-handedly guided his team to six-wicket win over a disdain Delhi Daredevils. Two boundaries in the last over. There were so many magical moments in this innings. One of the matches where you want to highlights over and over again.\n\nAB de Villiers... what an absolute superman... For a moment you have to wonder about Rishabh Pant's knock... it was almost a knock of certainty for the youngster and it gave Delhi something to fight for. But he has been upstaged by a giant of world cricket. And there is no shame in that. The Daredevils weren't abject but you can only applaud when you go down to AB like that!\n\nGautam Gambhir, Delhi Daredevils captain : He took the game away from us. 175 was a good effort from the batsmen. The pitch was a bit tacky in the first six overs, Shreyas and Rishabh were unbelievable. At one stage we were thinking of 150-155. AB took the game away, we were just one-wicket away from winning the game. Spinners could have bowled better to him. At that stage we could have get, he took his chances and did well. Unbelievable. The best catch I have ever seen, because it was off his wrong hand as well. I would be lying if I say I am not concerned. Hopefully we can turn it around when we get back home. It's tough being on the road and end up losing. All the teams are pretty clumped together. If you look at the points table it is close. We just have to push in with them\n\nAB de Villiers played one of the best T20 knocks today and while all other teams are thinking of how to deal with him in remainder of the tournament, Ben Stokes already has a simple solution.\n\nVirat Kohli, Royal Challengers Bangalore captain: I think this 30 runs is much bigger than 90 I got in last game. 2 points very crucial here, still few areas we need to correct. Happy memories tonight. We understand each other's game. My job was to stay there. Pity I could not stay there till the end. He (AB) comes in and changes the whole complexion of the game, that is why de Villiers is the best in the world. In IPL, you see such catches. You feel bad getting out on them. Hats off to Trent. Plus is till the 15 the over mark we were spot on with the ball. We can still rectify some areas. RCB crowd have always cheered for us. If the team believes, the crowd believes as well. They always come out in huge numbers.\n\nAB de Villiers : Some of the nights when you see the ball well. You don't often get that, you got to cash in when it happens. Didn't happen in last two games. Tonight I saw it early.When you do get on top of the bowler, you have to take it down. Best crowd in the world love playing here. Must say that when you do get into the zone, it is a buzz. Tonight it was just a buzz. Hopefully many more runs to come.\n\nThat's it from us today. It was simply Ab de Villiers day today. A 39-ball 90, which made the mockery of the Delhi bowling. It will take some time to come out of this innings. But wait, tomorrow we have more - A double header where Sunrises Hyderabad play Chennai Super Kings in the afternoon game while Mumbai take on Rajasthan Royals in the evening game. Till then...Take care and good night.\n\nPitch report: Not a lot of grass cover which is a bit of concern for me. It is a very good wicket and because of the rain factor teams must be looking to field first, says Matthew Hayden at the inspection.\n\nHarshal Patel set to debut for Delhi Daredevils against former team at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. He receives his cap from Ricky Ponting.\n\nOUT! This was coming. Delhi Daredevils were just not able to find the boundaries. Umesh bangs it short and Gambhir looks to pull it over midwicket. Doesn't time it at all and Chahal pouches it at midwicket. Once again, Umesh has struck in his first spell.\n\nOUT! It was on the cards, wasn't it? Yuzvendra Chahal bowls the quicker one and Roy gives himself room to cut it through cover but misses and the ball uproots the leg stump. A superb phase of play for RCB this.\n\nSIX! That's a biggie. Washington tosses it around leg and Shreyas smokes it over midwicket.\n\nFIFTY! A fine knock from Shreyas Iyer. He has pulled Delhi out fo trouble with the help of Pant. Completes the milestone with a six.\n\nOUT! Soft dismissal. Very soft. Shreyas Iyer must be fuming. A nothing delivery from Washington. Bowls it wide and full outside off, Shreyas chases it and it takes the leading edge. Siraj, positioned at short third man, pouches an easy catch.\n\nOUT! Maxwell tries a reverse-sweep but fails big time. The ball takes the edge off the bat and Siraj catches it diving at short third-man. Maxwell c Siraj b Chahal 4(6)\n\nOUT! And a wonderful inning comes to an end. Pant perishes as he hits one into the sky but this time ball won't travel too far and is caught by de Villiers at mid-on. Pant c de Villiers b Corey Anderson 85(48)\n\nOUT! Manan Vohra falls into trap and slog-sweeps Maxwell. The ball flies in the air and Jason Roy takes a good catch. The third umpire has a look but there is no confusion. That was a clean catch. Delhi draw first blood. Vohra, out Caught by Roy!! Vohra c Roy b Maxwell 2(5)\n\nOUT! And right after the reprieve to Kohli, RCB makes another blunder. No communication between de kock and Kohli as they try to take an impossible single. Kohli calls for it. De Kock was not ready and hence, the left-handed batsman falling short by big margin. de Kock run out (Vijay Shankar/Pant) 18(16)\n\nOUT! What was that. Boult pulls out a blinder. On the legs and Kohli flicks it, the ball appears to be going above the fine leg fielder but all of a sudden Boult grabs it flying in the air and falls just above the boundary ropes, his jersey almost touching the ropes. Kohli c Boult b Harshal Patel 30(26)\n\nOUT! Clean Bowled as Trent Boult uproots the leg stump of Corey Anderson. Too late, it seems. Corey Anderson b Boult 15(13)\n\nRCB win by 6 wickets. De villiers drives it for a beautiful boundary through the covers.\n\nThat's a wrap for today from AB de Villiers who single-handedly guided his team to six-wicket win over a disdain Delhi Daredevils. Two boundaries in the last over. There were so many magical moments in this innings. One of the matches where you want to highlights over and over again.\n\nIPL 2018, Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Delhi Daredevils, latest update and cricket score: That's a wrap for today from AB de Villiers who single-handedly guided his team to six-wicket win over a disdain Delhi Daredevils. Two boundaries in the last over. There were so many magical moments in this innings. One of the matches where you want to highlights over and over again.\n\nBoth teams have struggled to get going this season with just one win apiece from the four games each have played so far.\n\nWith just two points, the Gautam Gambhir-led Delhi side are at the eighth place in the points table. RCB have the same number of points but sit a place above Delhi with a slightly better net run-rate.\n\nIn their campaign opener against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Bengaluru failed in defending a competitive 177 runs but salvaged a win in their second game by chasing a moderate 156 runs against Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) at home.\n\nThey later went on to be on the receiving end in the games against Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Mumbai Indians (MI), losing by 19 and 46 runs respectively.\n\nOther than Kohli, the other big names in the RCB squad have failed to fire till now. While the RCB skipper has amassed 201 runs from four outings, averaging 67.00, AB de Villers, Quinton de Kock and Brendon McCullum have accumulated 122, 94 and 47 runs respectively.\n\nIn the bowling department, pacer Chris Woakes has been impressive with eight wickets from four games while Umesh Yadav has also provided the much needed breakthrough whenever his side needed.\n\nUmesh has pocketed seven wickets from four games.\n\nHowever, the main cause of concern for Bengaluru has been the death bowling as the side has leaked too many runs in the dying moments.\n\nOn the other hand, Delhi too, had a poor start to their IPL 2018 campaign after losing their first two games against KXIP and RR. The Gautam Gambhir-led side received their first win against Mumbai, thanks to a fine knock by foreigner Jason Roy and Rishabh Pant.\n\nWhile Jason slammed an unbeaten 53-ball 91, Rishabh chipped in with valuable 47 to help Delhi hunt down a challeging 195 runs.\n\nDelhi however, failed to repeat the story against KKR as they succumbed to chase 201 runs against KKR and lost the issue by 71 runs.\n\nFor Delhi, only Rishabh has looked good so far with the willow while Ray, who played a match winning knock against Mumbai, has featured in just two games. The other batters, including skipper Gambhir, have struggled to gather runs.\n\nIn the bowling unit, young leggie Rahul Tewatia has lived upto the expectations of the franchise after scalping six wickets from four games. The 24-year-old has also been economical with 7.13 runs per over (rpo).\n\nPacer Trent Boult has also same number of wickets but has been slightly expensice after 8.62 rpo.\n\nThe Bangalore side will however, be the favorites in Saturday's clash as out of 18 matches in the IPL overall, the Kohli-led team has won 12 and Delhi has won the remaining 6.\n\nThe squads:\n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli (captain), AB de Villiers, Sarfaraz Khan, Brendon McCullum, Chris Woakes, Colin de Grandhomme, Moeen Ali, Quinton de Kock, Umesh Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manan Vohra, Kulwant Khejroliya, Aniket Choudhary, Navdeep Saini, Murugan Ashwin, Mandeep Singh, Washington Sundar, Pawan Negi, Mohammed Siraj, Parthiv Patel, Aniruddha Joshi, Pavan Deshpande, Tim Southee, Corey Anderson\n\nDelhi Daredevils: Shreyas Iyer, Chris Morris, Rishabh Pant, Glenn Maxwell, Gautam Gambhir (captain), Jason Roy, Colin Munro, Mohammed Shami, Amit Mishra, Prithvi Shaw, Rahul Tewatia, Vijay Shankar, Harshal Patel, Avesh Khan, Shahbaz Nadeem, Daniel Christian, Jayant Yadav, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Trent Boult, Manjot Kalra, Abhishek Sharma, Sandeep Lamichhane, Naman Ojha, Sayan Ghosh, Liam Plunkett\n\nWith inputs from IANS"}, {"link": "http://www.newsweek.com/venezuelan-police-charge-against-doctors-patients-during-health-care-shortage-896193", "title": "Venezuelan police charged against doctors, patients during health care shortage protests", "text": "This week, patients and doctors joined forces to protest in public hospitals across Venezuela, demanding an increase in salaries and medicine supply.

It contained several anonymous case studies of the problems facing the Windrush generation.\n\nThe Labour MP David Lammy, who has been a leading campaigner for those members of the Windrush generation experiencing difficulties, told The Independent: \u201cIt is utterly extraordinary that the Home Office was clearly aware of the impact that their pernicious policies would have, yet ignored all the warnings and impact assessments.\n\n\u201cThe apologies made by the home secretary and prime minister are merely crocodile tears given that they were fully aware of the human cost that their policies would have.

Apparently, the undeclared \u201cWhatsApp hartal\u201d was called by social media groups on Monday, seeking justice for the eight-year-old gang-rape and murder victim in Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir. But police now suspects it was an attempt to spread communal discord in the state. The flash strike resulted in large scale violence in Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Palakkad and Kasaragode. Normal life was badly affected in all these districts. With no one owning responsibility for the bandh, it was free for all with lumpen elements making the most of it. According to reports from these districts, mobs supporting the bandh allegedly vandalised shops and business establishments; stoned and burned private and public vehicles. Even those on their way to attend weddings and funerals were not spared. Public transport came to a halt. Several police personnel and passersby were injured in the violence. Police have taken 250 people in judicial custody and declared prohibitory orders for a week in many parts of north Kerala. Now an alert has been sounded for the next three days, following intelligence inputs of communal riots being planned in parts of the state. According to the police, most of the arrested belonged to Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of the Popular Front of India, an organisation the Central government plans to ban. However, no political party or any other group had owned up to issuing the bandh call. The ruling CPM and the opposition Congress leaders were taken aback by the mass response to the bandh. They had absolutely no clue as to what was happening in those five districts. Most of the leaders came to know of it through television channels. It is a shame on the part of mainstream political parties that their organisations failed to intervene and bring things under control, especially in areas where they have considerable influence.\n\nEven as the police is in the dark over the instigators behind the hartal, it is somewhat clear that the aim of the hartal-mongers was to disrupt communal harmony in the state. There are allegations that arsonists targeted the members of a particular community while enforcing the bandh in those affected areas. The BJP on Wednesday sought a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the incidents. The party\u2019s state president, Kummanam Rajasekharan said the assailants wanted to unleash communal violence in north Kerala. \u201cExtremists have found their way into the ruling CPM. So the NIA should probe into the violence that took place under the guise of the hartal,\u201d he said. Three days after the hartal, police has arrested around 950 people in connection with \u201cthe premeditated political act that pitted communities and disrupted life in certain areas\u201d. More arrests are to follow. Though there is concrete evidence as such to terrorist links, the arrested include activists from Muslim militant groups, Muslim League, Congress and even the CPM. That militant communal forces have successfully infiltrated into the ranks of mainstream political parties is seen as a dangerous trend. There have been intelligence reports that northern Kerala has become a hotbed of terrorists, with many families reporting members joining Islamic militants abroad. But it seems that police and the government have not taken their activities seriously enough. Otherwise how can one explain the swelling of ranks of SDPI and the Welfare Party of India, the political front of the Jamaat-e-Islami? Both organisations have condemned the arrests of its members, but not the bandh or the violence that followed. \u201cThe police are hunting people from the minority community over a hartal called on social media. It was quite natural to have such reactions against atrocities by the Sangh Parivar,\u201d Welfare Party secretary Sajid Khan said.\n\nBut the question remains: Who is responsible for this false hartal? It cannot be denied that at the final count it is the government of the day which is responsible for keeping law and order in the state. The government has failed in its duty. What is the duty of the police if the force cannot detect that such a bandh was going to take place and take prompt action to thwart the same? What was its cyber cell doing? There is no answer to this except the state police chief Loknath Behera promising stringent action against those found responsible for the bandh call. Going by past experiences, these are mere hollow threats, just for the sake of public consumption. Promises are not translated at the ground level. Such anonymous bandhs can happen again. There is no guarantee that it can\u2019t. The Chief Minister, who is also the home minister, is yet to respond to the happenings of 16 April. Time and again his police has failed the system, but he is refusing to hand over the crucial portfolio to someone else. Vijayan seems to be following the footsteps of party ideologue E.M.S. Namboodiripad, who too held the home portfolio while leading the government; of course, to disastrous consequences. Marxists seem to have an uncanny knack for not learning from the past. But can it be at the cost of the state is the question."}, {"link": "https://www.ft.com/content/68e7856c-457f-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb", "title": "Chemical weapons inspectors arrive in Douma", "text": "Keep abreast of significant corporate, financial and political developments around the world.

(AP) \u2014 Facebook has taken the lion's share of scrutiny from Congress and the media about data-handling practices that allow savvy marketers and political agents to target specific audiences, but it's far from alone. YouTube, Google and Twitter also have giant platforms awash in more videos, posts and pages than any set of human eyes could ever check. Their methods of serving ads against this sea of content may come under the microscope next.\n\nAdvertising and privacy experts say a backlash is inevitable against a \"Wild West\" internet that has escaped scrutiny before. There continues to be a steady barrage of new examples where unsuspecting advertisers had their brands associated with extremist content on major platforms.\n\nIn the latest discovery, CNN reported that it found more than 300 retail brands, government agencies and technology companies had their ads run on YouTube channels that promoted white nationalists, Nazis, conspiracy theories and North Korean propaganda.\n\nChild advocates have also raised alarms about the ease with which smartphone-equipped children are exposed to inappropriate videos and deceptive advertising.\n\n\"I absolutely think that Google is next and long overdue,\" said Josh Golin, director of the Boston-based Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, which asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Google-owned YouTube's advertising and data collection practices earlier this month.\n\nYouTube has repeatedly outlined the ways it attempts to flag and delete hateful, violent, sexually explicit or harmful videos, but its screening efforts have often missed the mark.\n\nIt also allows advertisers avoid running ads on sensitive content \u2014 like news or politics \u2014 that don't violate YouTube guidelines but don't fit with a company's brand.

YouTube has since deleted the offending channel, but the Hollywood firm says it has unanswered questions about how it happened in the first place.\n\n\"All of our filters were in place in order to ensure that this did not happen,\" Fox said, adding it has asked for a refund of any money shared with the \"abhorrent channel.\"\n\nYouTube said Friday that it has made \"significant changes to how we approach monetization\" with \"stricter policies, better controls and greater transparency\" and said it allows advertisers to exclude certain channels from ads. It also removes ads when it's notified of problems running beside content that doesn't comply with its policies. \"We are committed to working with our advertisers and getting this right.\"\n\nSo far, just one major advertiser \u2014 Baltimore-based retailer Under Armour \u2014 had said it had withdrawn its advertising in the wake of the CNN report, though the lull lasted only a few days last week when it was first notified of the problem. After its shoe commercial turned up on a channel known for espousing white nationalist beliefs, Under Armour worked with YouTube to expand its filters to exclude certain topics and keywords.\n\nOn the other hand, Procter & Gamble, which had kept its ads off of YouTube since March 2017, said it had come back to the platform but drastically pared back the channels it would advertise on to under 10,000. It has worked on its own, with third parties, and with YouTube to create its restrictive list.\n\nThat's just a fraction of the some 3 million YouTube channels in the U.S. that accept ads, and is even more stringent than YouTube's \"Google Preferred\" lineup that focuses on the top most popular 5 percent of videos.\n\nThe CNN report was \"an illustration of exactly why we needed to go above and beyond just what YouTube's plans were and why we needed to take more control of where our ads were showing up,\" said P&G spokeswoman Tressie Rose.\n\nThe big problem, experts say, is that advertisers lured by the reach and targeting capability of online platforms can mistakenly expect the same standards for decency on network TV will apply online. In the same way, broadcast TV rules that require transparency about political ad buyers are absent on the web.\n\n\"There have always been regulations regarding appropriate conduct in content,\" says Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys Inc., a New York customer research firm. Regulating content on the internet is one area \"that has gotten away from everyone.\"\n\nAlso absent from the internet are many of the rules that govern children's programming on television sets. TV networks, for instance, are allowed to air commercial breaks but cannot use kids' characters to advertise products. Such \"host-selling\" runs rampant on internet services such as YouTube.\n\nAction to remove ads from inappropriate content is mostly reactive because of lack of upfront control of what gets uploaded, and it generally takes the mass threat of boycott to get advertisers to demand changes, according to BrandSimple consultant Allen Adamson. \"The social media backlash is what you're worried about,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, politicians are having trouble keeping up with the changing landscape, evident by how ill-informed many senators and congresspeople appeared during questioning of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this month.\n\n\"We're in the early stages of trying to figure out what kind of regulation makes sense here,\" said Larry Chiagouris, professor of marketing at Pace University in New York. \"It's going to take quite some time to sort that out.\"\n\n__\n\nO'Brien reported from Brookline, Massachusetts."}, {"link": "http://ew.com/theater/2018/04/21/harry-potter-cursed-child-jk-rowling-broadway-cast/", "title": "J.K.

I\u2019m not a Savedroid investor, but if I was I imagine that I would demand my money back.\n\nMore pointedly, can you imagine the uproar if a $50 million company in any other industry had attempted to pull a similar stunt?\n\nEven had the stunt been an April Fool\u2019s Day prank, it would have been in bad taste. The fact that it was not, only makes it that much more morbid.\n\nSavedroid might claim that it is raising awareness about the need for regulation in the nascent ICO space, but the truth is that it is contributing to the problem.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."}, {"link": "http://metro.co.uk/2018/04/21/two-people-killed-death-toll-london-hits-60-7486315/", "title": "Two more people killed as

For iPhones, iPad and Apple Watches you'll be asked to fill out a form attesting to the product's condition and given a trade-in quote, with a working iPhone 5 going for $35 and an iPhone 7 Plus scoring you $315. For Macs you'll be asked to provide a serial number as well. Though Apple won't give you any cash for anything deemed old or unacceptable, you can still mail it in or bring it to any Apple Store so it can be responsibly disposed of.\n\nDell\n\nDell offers drop-off recycling via a partnership with Goodwill. Not every location participates, but there are over 2,000 that do. And, because it's a charity, you may even be able to deduct it as a donation on your taxes. Dell also has a mail-back program on its site where you can generate a shipping label and drop off the package off at a FedEx location instead.\n\nEpson\n\nYou can ship old product back to Epson by simply creating a shipping label on its site and dropping it off at a FedEx location.\n\nHP\n\nIf you can, HP recommends taking its products to the nearest Best Buy or Staples. But if that's not feasible, the company participates in a program that will even buy back some items. You'll be asked to fill out a form with the make, model and condition, and the recycler will email you a prepaid shipping label to mail the package within 30 days. If you're doing a buyback you'll receive a paper check in the mail. Because this isn't an in-house program with HP, you can also send in items from other companies -- check the drop down list for firms like Canon and Toshiba as well as more obscure and out-of-business manufacturers.\n\nOther manufacturers\n\nMany other companies use outside recyclers to dispose of their products, and you'll often see the same names popping up again and again across different manufacturers. This should simplify things in some cases -- you should be able to send in products from multiple sources in one package. You just need to fill in the make and model to generate a prepaid shipping label. However, different states have different rules on what you can return, so the drop-downs for selecting your product may vary by jurisdiction.\n\nTwo major recycling companies you'll notice a lot are RLGA, which covers Acer, Canon, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft and Motorola, and MRM, which recycles product for Alcatel, BlackBerry, Barnes & Noble (nook), TCL and Toshiba.\n\nPhones\n\nCellphones are the easiest gadget to recycle -- if you haven't already decided to sell yours off on eBay or via sites like DeCluttr, Gazelle and ecoATM. But, if you can't or won't make some cold, hard cash off of it, you can send it to:\n\nCall2Recycle, which has drop-off centers all over the country in many chain stores, including Lowes and Home Depot. They'll also accept rechargeable batteries as well.\n\nCell Phones for Soldiers, which accepts phones in any condition and sells them to refurbishers or recyclers. The proceeds go toward purchasing phone cards for troops so they can call their friends and family back home. To be clear, the phones are not given directly to the soldiers.\n\nAll four of the major carriers, including Verizon and T-Mobile, offer free recycling as well. You can trade in your old device in-store or send it in for a credit toward a new phone, or let them straight up recycle it. AT&T participates in Cell Phones for Soldiers, while Sprint runs the 1Million Project, which works to get disadvantaged kids devices and internet access.\n\nIf you do decide to try your luck with Gazelle or ecoATM to see if your old phone is still worth a few bucks and it turns out it's worth nothing, you can at least rest easy knowing that both companies will recycle your phone responsibly.\n\nStates\n\nThere may not be a national law dictating that you must recycle your electronics, but at least 26 states have passed their own rules that vary widely on what they demand of both manufacturers and consumers. Almost all states that do collect products for recycling provide this service for free, with the bill footed by the companies in some way. Most provide some local programs to help you get rid of your stuff, regardless of whether recycling your gadgets is required or optional.\n\nStates where you can no longer dispose of electronics in the regular trash and must recycle them include: California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe following states have laws requiring manufacturers to pay for recycling, but you, the consumer, are not actually required to recycle your electronics: Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nThe following states have some special circumstances worth noting:\n\nCalifornia: Consumers pay a small fee of $5 to $7 when they buy televisions and laptops. This is used to reimburse recyclers for the high cost of recycling these items, so you don't get it back when you turn in these items for collection.\n\nConnecticut: Does not allow recycling centers to charge you a fee for turning in electronics, so many organizations that would usually charge for recycling televisions and monitors do not accept them. Since you cannot dispose of them curbside, you can take them to a municipal transfer station for free.\n\nMichigan: In addition to hosting numerous drop-off sites, Michigan will also pay for you to recycle your old gadgets by mail.\n\nPennsylvania: Does not allow retailers to charge you a fee to recycle, so places like Best Buy and Staples will not accept televisions or monitors. Many recycling centers have also closed as a result of underfunding. Some non-profit recyclers may still accept the items, and you should check to see if your local government is hosting any drop-off events. Lancaster and Dauphin Counties also still run civic recycling programs.\n\nWith it becoming more difficult to get rid of an old TV in Pennsylvania, with some people even resorting to illegal dumping, state senator Richard Alloway II introduced a bill last June mandating a fee on new purchases to offset the cost to recycling facilities. It's been sitting in committee for the past year."}, {"link": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirav-modi-is-in-hong-kong/article23631006.ece", "title": "It\u2019s official: Nirav Modi is in Hong Kong", "text": "Based on inputs gathered through intelligence sources, investigating agencies have confirmed that fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who is wanted in connection with the \u20b913,578-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud cases, is still in Hong Kong and his whereabouts have been established.\n\nIndia has already sent a request to Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Justice seeking the fugitive\u2019s provisional arrest, citing the cases registered against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, and the non-bailable warrant issued against him by the competent Indian court.\n\nHowever, as recently stated by the Ministry of External Affairs, the Hong Kong authorities are still examining India\u2019s request and are yet to respond.

But Israel has a long history of suspected targeting of wanted Palestinian militants in daring overseas operations around the globe and has been linked to other assassinations as well, though it has rarely publicly acknowledged them.\n\nMalaysian police say the 34-year-old al-Batsh was gunned down early Saturday by two assailants who shot at least eight bullets from a motorbike as he was heading to a mosque for dawn prayers in Kuala Lampur. It said closed-circuit television footage showed him targeted by assassins who had waited for him for almost 20 minutes.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said the government was looking into the possibility of the involvement of \u201cforeign agents\u201d in his killing. He told local media that initial investigations showed the assailants were \u201cwhite men\u201d driving a powerful BMW 1100cc motorbike.\n\nBesides his Hamas affiliation, al-Batsh was also a cousin of Khaled al-Batsh, a senior official in the Islamic Jihad militant group, who accused Mossad of the assassination, without providing evidence.\n\nThough Hamas stressed al-Batsh\u2019s scientific background, the funeral service of the Islamic movement\u2019s militant wing suggested al-Batsh was actually one of its military commanders. At a mourning tent in the Gaza Strip, a banner described al-Batsh as a member of the military wing. Ten masked militants in camouflage uniforms stood in a line outside the tent in Jabaliya, the slain man\u2019s hometown, to greet mourners. The ceremony is typical for senior Hamas commanders.\n\nAl-Batsh specialized in electrical and electronic engineering and worked at a Malaysian university. He had lived there with his family for the past eight years and was an imam at a local mosque.\n\nHe received his Ph.D degree from the University of Malaya in 2015 and was a senior lecturer at the British Malaysian Institute. His official biography said his research interests included power converters, power quality and renewable energy.\n\nHowever, Israeli media reported that he was also deeply involved in the Hamas drone development project.\n\nIsrael and Hamas are bitter foes who have fought three wars since 2008. Tensions have risen in recent weeks with a series of mass protests along the Gaza border in which 32 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli troops since late March.\n\nHamas says the protests are aimed at breaking a crippling border blockade that was imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group overran Gaza in 2007, a year after winning Palestinian parliamentary elections. It says it also aims to assert the right of refugees to return to their former homes in Israel.\n\nIsrael accuses Hamas, which is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction and has carried out dozens of deadly suicide bombings against it, of cynically exploiting Gaza civilians for its political aims by staging the protests and trying to carry out attacks under their cover.\n\nIsrael has used lethal force against unarmed protesters, but it says it is only targeting instigators who are trying to damage the border fence with explosives, firebombs and other means. However, the United Nations, the European Union and rights groups have questioned Israel\u2019s use of force when soldiers\u2019 lives are not in danger and the U.N. and E.U. have called for investigations.\n\nProtests are aiming to culminate in a large border march on May 15, the 70th anniversary of Israel founding. The date is mourned by Palestinians as their \u201cnakba,\u201dor catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands were uprooted in the 1948 Mideast war over Israel\u2019s creation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur contributed to this report."}, {"link": "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/decoding-the-congress-playbook/article23631133.ece", "title": "Decoding the Congress playbook", "text": "more-in\n\nMoments after submitting the impeachment notice against Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra on Friday, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad stressed that the Congress had sought an appointment with Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu a week ago. The remark was meant to underscore that the move was not a \u201crevenge petition\u201d against the Supreme Court for dismissing pleas for an investigation into the death of CBI Special Judge B.H. Loya.\n\nCongress leaders suggest that the impeachment motion is the first step in what could turn out to be a long-drawn battle.\n\nConstitutional right\n\n\u201cIt is a constitutional right of the MPs which has been exercised and further steps will also happen. First, under the Judges Inquiry Act and then under other constitutional provisions,\u201d Congress Rajya Sabha member and lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi told The Hindu.\n\nMr. Singhvi had earlier opposed the impeachment move and was reluctant to sign the motion submitted to the Vice-President. Former Ministers Ashwani Kumar, Salman Khursid and Manish Tewari had also expressed reservations, but the Congress seems to working to a plan, assuming that Mr. Naidu may not admit the motion.\n\nAsked what would the Congress do, if the Rajya Sabha Chairman rejects the notice, Kapil Sibal, one of the driving forces behind the Opposition move, said, \u201cWe will let you know then. There are many provisions in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nJudicial challenge\n\nIf the motion is rejected, there are indications that the Congress and other parties who signed the petition could approach the Supreme Court to challenge the Chairman\u2019s order. And since the matter relates to the CJI, it has to be heard by judges who are next in line in terms of seniority and experience.\n\nIf the motion does get accepted by Mr. Naidu, then a three-member Committee of a Supreme Court judge, the Chief Justice of a High Court and an eminent jurist will be formed to examine the charges against the CJI.\n\n\u201cThe convention is that once a judge faces impeachment proceedings, then the judge in question does not decide judicial matters. Since there have been only a few instances in the past of High Court judges facing impeachment, the Chief Justice of the particular High Court usually didn\u2019t assign cases to such a judge. But right now, the situation is without a precedent,\u201d a Congress leader said.\n\nOn Friday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley called the impeachment notice a \u201crevenge petition\u201d, and accused the Congress of using it as a \u201cpolitical tool\u201d.\n\nInadequate numbers\n\nIn the Rajya Sabha, support of 164 out of 244 MPs are needed to carry an impeachment motion through. And with the Opposition divided and the Trinamool and the DMK refusing to be part of the petition, the numbers look unachievable. In the Lok Sabha, the number is 360 and simply beyond the Opposition\u2019s reach.\n\nBut Congress members argue that the functioning of the CJI has raised serious questions of \u201cjudicial independence and institutional integrity\u201d while defending the move.\n\n\u201cYou have got to do what you have got to do.

Bush, regularly attended services.\n\nMrs. Bush died Tuesday at age 92.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama and wife Michelle, former president Bill Clinton and wife Hillary and first lady Melania Trump are among the estimated 1,500 people attending.\n\nPresident Trump, following custom, is not attending the funeral but posted a photo of Mrs. Bush's official portrait in the White House in remembrance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSon Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, was expected to deliver a eulogy, as was longtime friend Susan Baker, wife of former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, according to a family spokesman.\n\nAt about 9 a.m., tour buses began delivering guests to St. Martin's Episcopal Church, as clusters of Houston Police officers and state troopers patrolled the perimeter.\n\n\n\nAs the occasional helicopter circled overhead, camouflage-clad troops peered through binoculars from the rooftops of nearby buildings and police motorcycles drove through the streets outside the church, silent but with lights blazing.\n\nVIPs filled up the first 10 rows of pews, and included members of first families dating back to the Kennedys. Barack and Michelle Obama took their seat in the left front row, next to Bill and Hillary Clinton. At the far end of the same row sat former vice presidents Dick Cheney and Dan Quails, with their second ladies.\n\nAcross the aisle, George H.W. Bush was wheeled into his position, front row right side, wearing his trademark colorful socks, with pictures of books in homage to his wife's longtime commitment to promoting literacy.\n\nOther guests filled all the pews on the floor and rear balcony of the cavernous church. As more guests streamed in, extra folding chairs were brought out. Some women wore blue outfits, an homage to Barbara Bush's affinity for wearing blue.\n\nAs the casket entered the church, eight pallbearers \u2014 all Bush grandchildren \u2014 gently placed their hands on the casket containing Barbara Bush and wheeled it down the length of the middle aisle, then took their seats.\n\nThe casket was draped over with a large cloth covering embroidered with a golden cross.\n\nTraditional hymns played on a pipe organ: \"Nearer My God,\" \"Praise to the Lord,\" \"In the Garden,\" and \"Amazing Grace.\"\n\nHer granddaughters read scripture passages from Ecclesiastes (\"For everything there is a season\"), and from Proverbs.\n\n\"A capable wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain,\" the passage began.\n\nHistorian Jon Meacham, a biographer of Mrs. Bush's husband, began his eulogy with an example of her trademark humor. When he told her that he was mistaken at an airport bookstore for novelist John Grisham, she replied, \"How do you think poor John Grisham would feel? He's a very handsome man.\"\n\n\"It was a fair and funny point,\" Meacham said.\n\nFollowing the service, a motorcade will ferry Barbara Bush's body 90 miles northwest to the George Bush Presidential Library Center on the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, near which she will be laid to rest in a private burial.\n\nOn Friday, about 2,500 people attended the public viewing of Barbara Bush's casket. They arrived early at Second Baptist Church and were shuttled to St. Martin's after security sweeps. Attendees got a surprise visit from George H.W. Bush, who decided last minute to greet visitors.\n\n\"It was entirely the president's idea to go there,\" Jim McGrath, the president's spokesman, told The Associated Press.\n\nMany of the women at Friday's viewing wore blue blouses or pearl necklaces in honor of Barbara Bush.\n\nOne of those pearl-wearing visitors, Carolyn Bischoff, drove 36 miles from the Houston suburb of Dickinson to attend. Bischoff said she admired Barbara Bush's tough persona, wit and dedication to fighting illiteracy. But her lasting memory of the former first lady is at Houston Astros games, her feet perched up on the seat in front of her, scoring the game on a scorecard, she said.\n\n\"The pearls I'm wearing today are for her,\" Bischoff said. \"But I do wish I'd worn them with my World Series Astros T-shirt. I think she would've gotten a good laugh and given me a thumbs up for that, too.\"\n\nThe Bushes moved 29 times during their marriage but settled in Houston in 1959, according to the National First Ladies' Library. It was here that George H.W. Bush began his career in politics, getting elected to Republican Party chairman of Harris County in 1962.\n\nThroughout their six decades in Houston, the couple became integral members of the community, attending theaters and Astros games, becoming active in charity events, and, through her namesake foundation, the Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation, helping thousands of Houston-area kids to learn to read.\n\nAmong those in attendance on Saturday will be Fawaz \"Fuzzy\" Hajjar, a Syrian national and owner of Fuzzy's Pizza & Cafe, and his wife, Rita Hajjar. The Bushes were regulars at Fuzzy's for more than 25 years and became close friends with the Hajjars, inviting them to birthday parties and sharing dinners.\n\n\"It's unforutante to lose such a woman,\" Rita Hajjar said. \"People truly loved her.\""}, {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43853232", "title": "FA Cup: Manchester United 2-1 Tottenham highlights", "text": "Ander Herrera and Alexis Sanchez cancel out Dele Alli's early opener to put Manchester United into a record-equalling 20th FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham at Wembley.\n\nMATCH REPORT: Manchester United 2-1 Tottenham\n\nAvailable to UK users only"}, {"link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/news/ireland/irish-news/nell-mccafferty-pro-lifers-are-right-about-some-things-1.3469975\t", "title": "Nell McCafferty: \u2018Pro-lifers are right about some things\u2019", "text": "Something went wrong...\n\nThis page may be lost but you don't need to be.

President Gerald Ford stands at right. AP file\n\nDuring the Reagan years, Barbara had an uneasy relationship with Nancy. Initially, Nancy preferred her own tight circle of California friends and didn't invite the Bushes to private social events. Their husbands had been political rivals. Nancy, an astute judge of talent, was smart enough to bring Jim Baker into the fold as chief of staff. But for the most part, the rest of the White House staff and cabinet came from the Reagan wing of the party. Personal rivalries between the two became apparent during the transition: When the Bushes won, Nancy did not invite Barbara to tour the living quarters until January 11 \u2014 much later than was traditional.\n\nInterestingly, before moving to the White House on Inauguration Day 1989, the Bushes had spent more time in the vice president\u2019s residence at the Naval Observatory than in any of their homes \u2014 in 45 years of marriage! Such was the nomadic life of their early Texas wildcatting years, their time in Congress, then China, New York for the United Nations \u2014 all the career moves Barbara managed so gracefully.\n\nAs important as Houston was in their lives, no place captured the heart and soul of either Bush like Kennebunkport. They loved Walker's Point. She had hoped to regain enough strength to spend her last days there, planning a move in May. I\u2019d heard tales of the summer retreat from my colleagues who\u2019d been treated to wild rides on the vice president\u2019s cigarette boat, with \u201941 at the helm.\n\nMy introduction to the Maine coast was during their first visit after winning the presidency, over Thanksgiving weekend in 1988.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t playing \u201caerobic\u201d golf, the president-elect wanted to run errands, preferably without being trailed by 100 reporters and camera crews. At first, the Bushes resisted accepting the new reality that they would be covered 24/7 by a pool of reporters and photographers. As a result, every time the president-elect went out, we all gave chase \u2014 individually in a disorganized scramble of rental cars.\n\nIt was an impossible challenge, and unwelcome intrusion, in the small Maine town. Finally, on the day before Thanksgiving '88, Bush came out of a hardware store, put up his hands and told all of us waiting outside that he was giving up. In fact, he was heading into the wine and cheese shop to buy provisions because \u201cBar\u201d wanted to invite us all over to Walker\u2019s Point for a tour.\n\nAdjusting to the \u201cjob\u201d as first lady \u2014 a job with no description \u2014 was challenging.

The military stood behind him as he led the country through a famine in the 1990s that killed more than two million people.\n\nIn 2012, in his first public speech as North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un said he would not let his people \u201ctighten their belt again,\u201d a startling admission of failure by a member of a ruling family that is seen as godlike and faultless.\n\nIn 2013, his Workers\u2019 Party adopted the byungjin policy, arguing that economic growth could occur only if the nation was secure. In a party congress in 2016, Mr. Kim said that byungjin was not a temporary step but a permanent strategy. In another party meeting in October, he said North Korea was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d when it pursued byungjin.\n\nExaggerating American hostility and creating a sense of empowerment through nuclear weapons has become a hallmark of state propaganda legitimizing Mr. Kim\u2019s dynastic rule.

Some analysts say that Mr. Kim is driven by a desperate need to ease sanctions that have crippled his country, and may try to get away with a temporary and deceptive freeze of his nuclear program. Others argue that he is acting in confidence that his nuclear weapons give him new leverage to rebuild the economy.\n\nIf Mr. Kim is serious about economic growth, though, he will need the world\u2019s help, analysts say.

Real estate records show that the transfer of ownership from Ms. Lindsey, the lobbyist, was rather complicated and involved multiple steps \u2014 none of them with any public reference to Mr. Pruitt, though the E.P.A. spokeswoman confirmed that he was one of five co-owners of the shell company.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen asked whether such a disclosure would be necessary, the executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, Ashley Kemp, referred The Times to a 2005 ethics manual. The rules required disclosing \u201cevery business or entity\u201d in which an official held securities valued at $5,000 or more. Securities were defined to include \u201cdocuments that represent a share in a company.\u201d\n\nThe E.P.A. spokeswoman did not respond to questions about Mr. Pruitt\u2019s disclosure filings in Oklahoma.\n\nIn November 2003, Ms. Lindsey signed the deed of the home over to a relocation company SBC had hired to handle her move and severance. She was reimbursed for close to $475,000, the amount she had paid for the house in 2002, as her contract required, she said.\n\nThe next day, the relocation company signed the property over to Jon Jiles, a health care executive who has a range of business interests and made contributions to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s political campaigns. Records show no mortgage was involved, and Mr. Jiles paid $375,000 in cash.\n\nThat December, Mr. Wagner officially registered the Capitol House shell company with the Oklahoma authorities, and Mr. Jiles transferred the deed to the newly formed company. Mr. Jiles was listed as a manager of Capitol House, and Mr. Wagner as the registered agent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe following month, SpiritBank, where Mr. Kelly was chief executive, approved a mortgage in the amount of $420,000 in the name of Capital House L.L.C., another spelling of the entity.\n\nMs. Lindsey, the former lobbyist, said she had been focused on her impending move to Dallas, and had deferred the sale and other arrangements to the company\u2019s relocation agent.

The valuation and sale were handled by the relocation business, the company added.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Jiles, in an email exchange, said he became involved because Mr. Wagner presented the house as \u201ca good deal\u201d and a convenient place to stay.

Moreover, SBC was known to court lawmakers with gifts, including tickets for Mr. Pruitt and others to watch Oklahoma State University play in the men\u2019s basketball Final Four in 2004, The Oklahoman reported at the time.\n\n\u201cIt gives us a chance to try to build a relationship with a lawmaker or an official,\u201d a spokesman, Andy Morgan, told the newspaper. \u201cEvents like that offer a much more relaxed atmosphere.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re one of the state\u2019s largest employers. It\u2019s important that lawmakers are informed about issues affecting our company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe prospect of another investigation into a longstanding bribery case had especially rattled SBC. In the early 1990s, an SBC lobbyist had been found guilty in federal court of paying a bribe to a public utilities commissioner to sway a vote that allowed the company to keep federal tax savings rather than disburse them to its ratepayers. But the vote itself was never overturned, and in 2003, another commissioner proposed reopening the investigation, claiming SBC still owed billions of dollars in refunds. The commissioner dropped his plans for an investigation after state legislators, and the attorney general at the time, Drew Edmondson, pushed back against the effort.\n\nLater, when Mr. Pruitt became attorney general, he helped quash another attempt to revisit the SBC bribery case. In a March 2011 letter, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office warned that any commissioner who reopened the investigation could face prosecution for the misuse of public funds.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Run of Good Fortune\n\nAround the same time Mr. Pruitt invested in the house in Oklahoma City, he had finished a big business deal that involved Mr. Kelly, Mr. Wagner and a campaign donor who ran a large staffing company.\n\nA baseball player in college, Mr. Pruitt bought an approximately 25 percent stake in the Oklahoma City RedHawks and became the team\u2019s managing partner, making him a highly visible spokesman for the local team. Mr. Wagner also purchased a small stake, and Mr. Kelly\u2019s bank provided financing for the deal, as first reported by The Intercept, which also disclosed the bank\u2019s loans for one of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s suburban Tulsa homes.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s main partner was Robert Funk, the business magnate who ran Express Services, the staffing firm. The sale price was not disclosed, but news reports suggested they paid over $11.5 million, with Mr. Funk carrying the biggest load.\n\nTwo months after the deal closed in November 2003, Mr. Funk attended a news conference where Mr. Pruitt announced legislation that would make it harder for Oklahoma workers to claim certain kinds of injury compensation, something that would benefit companies like Mr. Funk\u2019s.\n\nThe relationship continued, with Mr. Funk serving as campaign chairman during Mr. Pruitt\u2019s unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2006. Mr. Pruitt announced his candidacy outside the ballpark and cited his efforts on workers\u2019 compensation among his achievements.\n\nAfter losing the election, Mr. Pruitt took a break from public office, but continued his business relationship with Mr. Funk, proposing a $200 million town center on a parking lot next to the ballpark. The City Council balked at the project, but Mr. Pruitt\u2019s ambitions and prominence grew.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBack at home in Tulsa, Mr. Pruitt worked with Mr. Wagner\u2019s firm, which had offices in SpiritBank\u2019s building. As a corporate lawyer, Mr. Wagner frequently represented the bank, but also represented a used car dealership run by Mr. Pruitt\u2019s family.\n\nIn 2004, Mr. Pruitt upgraded from a modest one-story home where his family had lived for over a decade to a $605,000 lakeside house a mile away. SpiritBank financed the home. The E.P.A. spokeswoman said Mr. Pruitt was able to afford the house \u201cdue to his sale of personal assets.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn September 2010, as Mr. Pruitt was on his way to successfully winning his race for attorney general, he and Mr. Funk announced that they had sold the RedHawks. They did not disclose the price, but Forbes estimated its value a few years later at $21 million. SpiritBank, where Mr. Kelly was still chief executive, \u201cplayed a key role in facilitating\u201d the deal by providing acquisition financing, a news release said.\n\nAs a candidate for attorney general, Mr. Pruitt was not required to disclose the extent of his assets and how much money he made, but there were hints that his finances had improved since his early days as a state senator. Early into his term, he and his wife paid $1.18 million for a 5,518-square-foot Cotswold-style stone residence, featured in a book on Tulsa homes. It has five fireplaces, a library and a guest apartment.\n\nThe Attorney General Years\n\nDuring his six years as attorney general, Mr. Pruitt blazed a path of spending that holds new meaning now that his E.P.A. expenditures are the subject of investigations and growing political outrage.\n\nMr. Pruitt moved the attorney general\u2019s outpost in Tulsa to a prime suite in the Bank of America tower, an almost $12,000-a-month space that quadrupled the annual rent. He required his staff to regularly drive him between Tulsa and Oklahoma City, according to several people familiar with his time as attorney general.\n\nAnd he channeled state contracts to Mr. Wagner\u2019s law firm, which was already doing business with the state.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2017, state records show, the attorney general\u2019s office awarded more than $600,000 in contracts to Mr. Wagner\u2019s Tulsa-based law firm, Latham, Wagner Steele & Lehman \u2014 greatly increasing work with the firm, which had gotten a total of about $100,000 over the four years before that. These contracts are not competitively bid. The additional expenditures reflected an approach, contentious even among some fellow Republicans, to hire private lawyers for state business, often for cases challenging federal regulations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe said that these people had special expertise that his agency didn\u2019t have,\u201d said Paul Wesselhoft, a Republican former state representative. \u201cHe has an army of lawyers with expertise. He didn\u2019t have to spend that extra tax money to hire another law firm. It didn\u2019t seem frugal.\u201d\n\nMr. Pruitt used the Bank of America building as a base for his growing political ambitions. Oklahoma Strong Leadership, a political action committee he formed in 2015 to help finance fellow Republicans\u2019 campaigns, operated out of the building. The group shared a suite with another PAC tied to Mr. Pruitt, Liberty 2.0, as well as his campaign office."}, {"link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/sport/rugby/european-cup/irrepressible-leinster-storm-into-champions-cup-final-1.3469966\t", "title": "Irrepressible Leinster storm into Champions Cup final", "text": "Something went wrong...\n\nThis page may be lost but you don't need to be.

There was an element of condescendion to the way that Larry Kudlow was speaking about her, saying \u2018Oh well she\u2019s just the kind of person that might get confused a bit.\u2019 And she was bold enough to push back and I suspect that she won\u2019t use that kind of lanuage about her again.

The answer arrived on April 18th, when the Turkish strongman pushed the vote forward by eighteen months, to June 24th 2018, earlier than almost everyone had expected. So what does Mr Erdogan hope to achieve by marching Turks to the polls for the sixth time in four years, and for the second time under emergency law?\n\nDespite posting an impressive 7.4% growth rate last year, thanks largely to a credit boom and a series of stimulus measures, Turkey\u2019s economy has begun to run out of steam. Inflation has been in double digits for over a year. In the space of a month, two of the country\u2019s biggest conglomerates entered talks to restructure as much as $9bn in debt. The Turkish lira, having already lost over half of its value against the dollar since 2013, has been setting record lows almost every day since late March. The currency rebounded on news of the snap election, a sign that investors expect Mr Erdogan and his Justice and Development (AK) party to cruise to a win and reduce stimulus spending.

The change was part of a package of constitutional amendments that gave Mr Erdogan sweeping new powers (it passed by a razor-thin margin in a controversial 2017 referendum). He enters the race once again with a giant head start. The rudderless opposition now has barely two months to mount a campaign. The main secular party has yet to come up with a credible candidate for president. The leaders of the main Kurdish party are in prison on trumped-up charges of terrorism. Speculation is mounting that a newly hatched nationalist party will not be allowed to run for parliament. Its leader, a former minister of interior, is the only major politician so far to challenge Mr Erdogan officially for the presidency.\n\nA fair election is not likely. Mr Erdogan has almost complete control over the media, including newspapers that account for roughly 90% of circulation. More than a hundred journalists are in prison. Under a state of emergency in place since July 2016 the president enjoys near-dictatorial powers.

Some Republicans are talking about it MORE had said a week ago that he would have to consider resigning if Rosenstein were fired.\n\nSpeculation about a move against Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller\u2019s probe, rose to a crescendo following raids on the home, hotel room and office of Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, less than two weeks ago.\n\nTrump at that time targeted Rosenstein in tweets. With regard to Mueller, he told reporters at the White House that \u201cmany people have said \u2018you should fire him.\u2019 \u201d\n\nReporting from The Hill during that period also indicated that some people in Trump\u2019s orbit who had previously argued against ousting Rosenstein had reversed course.\n\nIn recent days, however, Trump has mostly been less aggressive toward Rosenstein and Mueller, even as he has lambasted another antagonist, former FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyThe Memo: Trump lowers the temperature on Mueller probe 'Ethical' James Comey is under investigation for unethical acts Trump casts doubt on legality of special counsel Mueller MORE, who has hit the promotional trail in support of his new book.\n\nThat said, his anger at Comey and his attitude toward the probe cannot be completely separated \u2014 and they could yet prove an explosive combination.\n\nIn a Friday night tweet, Trump alleged that Comey had \u201cillegally leaked classified documents to the press,\u201d spurring the appointment of a special counsel. Comey denies the information was classified.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet seemed to call into question the legitimacy of Mueller\u2019s probe, arguing that it was \u201cestablished based on an illegal act.\u201d\n\nPeople close to Trump say there is no immediate plan to fire Rosenstein, or to make what they euphemistically term other \u201cpersonnel changes\u201d right now.\n\nRosenstein\u2019s assertion that Trump was not a target of the investigation is reported to have mollified Trump sufficiently that he told associates afterward that it was not the time to fire either him or Mueller.\n\nThe addition of Giuliani to Trump\u2019s legal team, announced on Thursday, pointed in the same direction. In a statement released by lead lawyer Jay Sekulow, Trump was quoted as saying that Giuliani \u201cwants to get this matter quickly resolved for the good of the country.\"\n\nGiuliani told The Washington Post that he hoped \u201cwe can negotiate an end to this.\u201d He told CNN that \u201ca little push\u201d could bring the investigation to a conclusion. He suggested that there was even the possibility that everything that still needed to be done to \u201ccomply\u201d with Mueller's demands could be done in \u201ca couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nThe idea of some kind of negotiation to bring an end to an investigation perplexed some legal experts.\n\n\u201cProsecutors don\u2019t settle their prosecutions,\u201d said Joyce White Vance, who served as the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama under former President Obama. \u201cI can\u2019t remember, ever, a prosecutor saying, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll terminate this investigation in three or four weeks.' \"\n\n\"That is just not how the work is done,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is not a deal. This is serious work \u2014 determining the truth and reaching the just outcome.\u201d\n\nThe lead White House lawyer on Mueller-related matters, Ty Cobb, told The Hill that Giuliani and others working for the president were in fact working toward a Trump interview with investigators that might speed the probe to a conclusion.\n\n\u201cRudy and others on the president's team have made it clear they would like to work quickly and diligently and set the terms of an interview,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cAnd such an interview would ideally be a catalyst to conclude this long experience.\u201d\n\nThere has been some gossip in Trump circles that Cobb himself might be displeased by Giuliani\u2019s arrival, but Cobb vigorously contested that.\n\nHe noted that he and the former New York City mayor had \u201cmade our bones together as prosecutors\u201d fighting against organized crime decades ago. He said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d that Giuliani was joining the president\u2019s team.\n\nAs for media coverage of the changes that have seen Giuliani and two Florida-based lawyers, Jane Serene Raskin and Marty Raskin, join the president\u2019s team, Cobb observed: \u201cFor the last month, people have been saying that Jay [Sekulow] was awfully understaffed. And now they are asking, unfairly, \u2018Why did you hire all these lawyers?\u2019 \"\n\nBeyond the additional personnel, Trump himself has seemed to adopt a more conciliatory tone.\n\nAt a news conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this week, Trump said, \u201cThey\u2019ve been saying I\u2019m going to get rid of [Mueller and Rosenstein] for the last three months, four months, five months. And they\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nThat said, predicting Trump\u2019s next move has long been a fool\u2019s errand. Some people in his orbit insist that his underlying anger about the investigation is as strong as ever.\n\n\u201cRosenstein is still at risk of being fired, especially because [Trump's] anger has not subsided,\u201d said one GOP operative.\n\nVance, the former Alabama district attorney, added her own note of caution regarding Trump\u2019s attitudes.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that he goes up and down and it is maybe not helpful to try to assess things minute by minute,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll only find out when he actually fires them. Many of these firings seem to have happened out of the blue.\u201d\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency."}, {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/21/politics/trump-cohen-new-york-times/index.html", "title": "Trump defends Cohen after NYT report", "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump aggressively defended his personal lawyer Saturday morning after The New York Times reported on Trump's sometimes poor treatment of the attorney, Michael Cohen, who the newspaper said might cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller in his probe into Russian election meddling.\n\nIn a series of tweets peppered with insults against the Times' White House correspondent, Maggie Haberman, and her sourcing, Trump wrote that she and the newspaper \"are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will 'flip.'

When you stop to consider that the world\u2019s biggest banks and financial services companies are located there, it would certainly make sense for security startups to concentrate on such a huge potential market \u2014 and it turns out, that\u2019s the case.\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, there are dozens of security startups based in the city with everything from biometrics and messaging security to identity, security scoring and graph-based analysis tools. Some established companies like Symphony, which was originally launched in the city (although it is now on the west coast), has raised almost $300 million. It was actually formed by a consortium of the world\u2019s biggest financial services companies back in 2014 to create a secure unified messaging platform.\n\nThere is a reason such a broad-based ecosystem is based in a single place. The companies who want to discuss these kinds of solutions aren\u2019t based in Silicon Valley. This isn\u2019t typically a case of startups selling to other startups. It\u2019s startups who have been established in New York because that\u2019s where their primary customers are most likely to be.\n\nIn this article, we are looking at a few promising early-stage security startups based in Manhattan\n\nHypr: Decentralizing identity\n\nHypr is looking at decentralizing identity with the goal of making it much more difficult to steal credentials. As company co-founder and CEO George Avetisov puts it, the idea is to get rid of that credentials honeypot sitting on the servers at most large organizations, and moving the identity processing to the device.\n\n\u201cThe goal of these companies in moving to decentralized authentication is to isolate account breaches to one person,\u201d Avetisov explained. When you get rid of that centralized store, and move identity to the devices, you no longer have to worry about an Equifax scenario because the only thing hackers can get is the credentials on a single device \u2014 and that\u2019s not typically worth the time and effort.\n\nAt its core, Hypr is an SDK. Developers can tap into the technology in their mobile app or website to force the authorization to the device. This could be using the fingerprint sensor on a phone or a security key like a Yubikey. Secondary authentication could include taking a picture. Over time, customers can delete the centralized storage as they shift to the Hypr method.\n\nThe company has raised $15 million and has 35 employees based in New York City.\n\nUplevel Security: Making connections with graph data\n\nUplevel\u2019s founder Liz Maida began her career at Akamai where she learned about the value of large data sets and correlating that data to events to help customers understand what was going on behind the scenes. She took those lessons with her when she launched Uplevel Security in 2014. She had a vision of using a graph database to help analysts with differing skill sets understand the underlying connections between events.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s build a system that allows for correlation between machine intelligence and human intelligence,\u201d she said. If the analyst agrees or disagrees, that information gets fed back into the graph, and the system learns over time the security events that most concern a given organization.\n\n\u201cWhat is exciting about [our approach] is you get a new alert and build a mini graph, then merge that into the historical data, and based on the network topology, you can start to decide if it\u2019s malicious or not,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company hopes that by providing a graphical view of the security data, it can help all levels of security analysts figure out the nature of the problem, select a proper course of action, and further build the understanding and connections for future similar events.\n\nMaida said they took their time creating all aspects of the product, making the front end attractive, the underlying graph database and machine learning algorithms as useful as possible and allowing companies to get up and running quickly. Making it \u201cself serve\u201d was a priority, partly because they wanted customers digging in quickly and partly with only 10 people, they didn\u2019t have the staff to do a lot of hand holding.\n\nSecurity Scorecard: Offering a way to measure security\n\nThe founders of Security Scorecard met while working at the NYC ecommerce site, Gilt. For a time ecommerce and adtech ruled the startup scene in New York, but in recent times enterprise startups have really started to come on. Part of the reason for that is many people started at these foundational startups and when they started their own companies, they were looking to solve the kinds of enterprise problems they had encountered along the way. In the case of Security Scorecard, it was how could a CISO reasonably measure how secure a company they were buying services from was.\n\n\u201cCompanies were doing business with third-party partners. If one of those companies gets hacked, you lose. How do you vett the security of companies you do business with\u201d company co-founder and CEO Aleksandr Yampolskiy asked when they were forming the company.\n\nThey created a scoring system based on publicly available information, which wouldn\u2019t require the companies being evaluated to participate. Armed with this data, they could apply a letter grade from A-F. As a former CISO at Gilt, it was certainly a paint point he felt personally. They knew some companies did undertake serious vetting, but it was usually via a questionnaire.\n\nSecurity Scorecard was offering a way to capture security signals in an automated way and see at a glance just how well their vendors were doing. It doesn\u2019t stop with the simple letter grade though, allowing you to dig into the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and see how they compare to other companies in their peer groups and how they have performed over time.\n\nIt also gives customers the ability to see how they compare to peers in their own industry and use the number to brag about their security position or conversely, they could use it to ask for more budget to improve it.\n\nThe company launched in 2013 and has raised over $62 million, according to Crunchbase. Today, they have 130 employees and 400 enterprise customers.\n\nIf you\u2019re an enterprise security startup, you need to be where the biggest companies in the world do business. That\u2019s in New York City, and that\u2019s precisely why these three companies, and dozens of others have chosen to call it home."}, {"link": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/21/datadog-and-new-york/", "title": "Through luck and grit, Datadog is fusing the culture of developers and operations", "text": "There used to be two cultures in the enterprise around technology. On one side were software engineers, who built out the applications needed by employees to conduct the business of their companies. On the other side were sysadmins, who were territorially protective of their hardware domain \u2014 the servers, switches, and storage boxes needed to power all of that software. Many a great comedy routine has been made at the interface of those two cultures, but they remained divergent.\n\nThat is, until the cloud changed everything. Suddenly, there was increasing overlap in the skills required for software engineering and operations, as well as a greater need for collaboration between the two sides to effectively deploy applications. Yet, while these two halves eventually became one whole, the software monitoring tools used by them were often entirely separate.\n\nNew York City-based Datadog was designed to bring these two cultures together to create a more nimble and collaborative software and operations culture. Founded in 2010 by Olivier Pomel and Alexis L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c, the product offers monitoring and analytics for cloud-based workflows, allowing ops team to track and analyze deployments and developers to instrument their applications. Pomel said that \u201cthe root of all of this collaboration is to make sure that everyone has the same understanding of the problem.\u201d\n\nThe company has had dizzying success. Pomel declined to disclose precise numbers, but says the company had \u201cnorth of $100 million\u201d of recurring revenue in the past twelve months, and \u201cwe have been doubling that every year so far.\u201d The company, headquartered in the New York Times Building in Times Square, employs more than 600 people across its various worldwide offices. The company has raised nearly $150 million of venture capital according to Crunchbase, and is perennially on banker\u2019s short lists for strong IPO prospects.\n\nThe real story though is just how much luck and happenstance can help put wind in the sails of a company.\n\nPomel first met L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c while an undergraduate in France. He was working on running the campus network, and helped to discover that L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c had hacked the network. L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c was eventually disconnected, and Pomel would migrate to IBM\u2019s upstate New York offices after graduation. After IBM, he led technology at Wireless Generation, a K-12 startup, where he ran into L\u00ea-Qu\u00f4c again, who was heading up ops for the company. The two cultures of develops and ops was glaring at the startup, where \u201cwe had developers who hated operations\u201d and there was much \u201cfinger-pointing.\u201d\n\nPutting aside any lingering grievances from their undergrad days, the two began to explore how they could ameliorate the cultural differences they witnessed between their respective teams. \u201cBringing dev and ops together is not a feature, it is core,\u201d Pomel explained. At the same time, they noticed that companies were increasingly talking about building on Amazon Web Services, which in 2009, was still a relatively new concept. They incorporated Datadog in 2010 as a cloud-first monitoring solution, and launched general availability for the product in 2012.\n\nLuck didn\u2019t just bring the founders together twice, it also defined the currents of their market. Datadog was among the first cloud-native monitoring solutions, and the superlative success of cloud infrastructure in penetrating the enterprise the past few years has benefitted the company enormously. We had \u201cexactly the right product at the right time,\u201d Pomel said, and \u201ca lot of it was luck.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s healthy to recognize that not everything comes from your genius, because what works once doesn\u2019t always work a second time.\u201d\n\nWhile startups have been a feature in New York for decades, enterprise infrastructure was in many ways in a dark age when the company launched, which made early fundraising difficult. \u201cNone of the West Coast investors were listening,\u201d Pomel said, and \u201cEast Coast investors didn\u2019t understand the infrastructure space well enough to take risks.\u201d Even when he could get a West Coast VC to chat with him, they \u201cthought it was a form of mental impairment to start an infrastructure startup in New York.\u201d\n\nThose fundraising difficulties ended up proving a boon for Datadog, because it forced the company to connect with customers much earlier and more often than it might have otherwise. Pomel said, \u201cit forced us to spend all of our time with customers and people who were related to the problem\u201d and ultimately, \u201cit grounded us in the customer problem.\u201d Pomel believes that the company\u2019s early DNA of deeply listening to customers has allowed it to continue to outcompete its rivals on the West Coast.\n\nMore success is likely to come as companies continue to move their infrastructure onto the cloud. Datadog used to have a roughly even mix of private and public cloud business, and now the balance is moving increasingly toward the public side. Even large financial institutions, which have been reticent in transitioning their infrastructures, have now started to aggressively embrace cloud as the future of computing in the industry, according to Pomel.\n\nDatadog intends to continue to add new modules to its core monitoring toolkit and expand its team. As the company has grown, so has the need to put in place more processes as parts of the company break. Quoting his co-founder, Pomel said the message to employees is \u201cdon\u2019t mind the rattling sound \u2014 it is a spaceship, not an airliner\u201d and \u201cthings are going to break and change, and it is normal.\u201d\n\nMuch as Datadog has bridged the gap between developers and ops, Pomel hopes to continue to give back to the New York startup ecosystem by bridging the gap between technical startups and venture capital. He has made a series of angel investments into local emerging enterprise and data startups, including Generable, Seva, and Windmill. Hard work and a lot of luck is propelling Datadog into the top echelon of enterprise startups, pulling New York along with it."}, {"link": "https://techcrunch.com/gallery/up-and-coming-enterprise-startups-in-nyc/", "title": "Up-and-coming enterprise startups in NYC", "text": "New York City has an incredible density of up-and-coming enterprise-focused startups.
